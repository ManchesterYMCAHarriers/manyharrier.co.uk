Fell races usually take place in remote and exposed areas, where weather 
conditions can change very quickly. Runners are strongly advised to take the 
following “best practice” equipment with them to every event:

* **Waterproof** whole body cover (i.e. covering the torso from the head to the 
  ankles)
* Other body cover appropriate for the weather conditions; as a minimum, this 
  will include a hat and gloves, but you may also wish to bring other equipment 
  such as a fleece
* A map (preferably waterproof) of the race route and surrounding areas 
  (maps can often be downloaded from race websites)
* A compass suitable for navigating the course (GPS type equipment is **not** 
  acceptable)
* A whistle
* Emergency food rations
* A bum-bag or back pack for carrying this equipment

**This equipment is mandatory for all “long” events, regardless of the 
prevailing or forecast weather conditions.**

For shorter events taking place in fine and settled weather, the race organiser 
may decide to waive some of these requirements.

Please note that some organisers may require runners to carry additional 
equipment beyond that listed above, for example, a lightweight foil bivi bag.

For full information about equipment requirements and other rules regarding fell
running, please consult the [Fell Runners Association website](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/).
