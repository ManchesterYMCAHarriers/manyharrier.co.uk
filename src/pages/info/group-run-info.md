## Session Format

Our group runs take place every Thursday, starting at the Y Club at 6:30pm. After a quick warm up, the Captains will gather the group together for Club Notices, after which we split into sub-groups before heading off on one of our many routes.

Each group will run at a different pace and will be led by a club member, so there should always be a pace group suited to you. The number of groups is flexible depending on the number of runners down on any particular night, but we’ll generally have the following six groups:

### Group 1:
- 8 miles (13 km)
- 7.00 min / mile (4.20 min / km) +/- 30 secs

### Group 2:
- 8 miles (13 km)
- 7.30 min / mile (4.40 min / km) +/- 30 secs

### Group 3:
- 8 miles (13 km)
- 8.30 min / mile (5.20 min / km) +/- 30 secs

### Group 4:
- 8 miles (13 km)
- 9.30 min / mile (5.50 min / km) +/- 30 secs

### Group 5:
- 6 miles (10 km)
- 10.00 min / mile (6.15 min / km) +/- 30 secs

### Group 6:
- 3 miles (5 km)
- This group will run at whatever pace is comfortable for everyone

If you’re not sure which group to go in on your first visit, we'd advise starting off in Group 6 and try to work your way up to the next one!
