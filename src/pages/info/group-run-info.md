## Session format

We meet at the Y Club reception at 6:30pm. After a quick warm up, the Captains 
will gather the group together for club notices, after which we’ll split into 
sub-groups before we head off on the run.

Each group will run at a different pace and will be led by a club member, so 
there should always be a pace group suited to you. The number of groups is 
flexible depending on the number of runners down on any particular night, but 
we’ll generally have the following four pace groups:

* **Group 1:** 7.00 min / mile (4.20 min / km) +/- 30 secs
* **Group 2:** 7.30 min / mile (4.40 min / km) +/- 30 secs
* **Group 3:** 8.30 min / mile (5.20 min / km) +/- 30 secs
* **Group 4:** 9.30 min / mile (5.50 min / km) +/- 30 secs

If you’re not sure which group to go in on your first visit, we'd advise 
starting off in Group 4 and try to work your way up to the next one!

Our routes are generally 6 - 8 miles (10 - 13km) but if you don't fancy running 
that far, we'll always offer a shorter alternative route of approximately 
3 miles (5km).
