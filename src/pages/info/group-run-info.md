## Important information for group runs during COVID-19 restrictions

While we remain under social distancing restrictions designed to reduce the
transmission of coronavirus, groups runs must adhere to the guidance published
by England Athletics and Public Health England.

At present, this means:

* **groups are strictly limited to a maximum of twelve participants**; 
* **you must sign up for the run in advance using the Doodle poll link above**; and
* **you agree to abide by the instructions on our [coronavirus group running guidance](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance) page.**

The sessions are intended to be "social" - it is a chance to meet and chat with 
your club mates who you may not have seen for ages! Therefore, the sessions 
will be run at a pace that is comfortable for everyone in the group.
