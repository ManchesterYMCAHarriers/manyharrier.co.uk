## Track speedwork sessions during COVID-19

There will be two sessions, both at the time of **6.15pm**. In keeping with Government, England 
Athletics and Longford Park guidelines, these sessions can hold a **maximum of 6 people**. To join a session, it is 
imperative you sign up beforehand as we will need to manage attendance as well as supply the track with a list of 
attendees prior to the session. Therefore, please sign up for sessions by Monday morning at the latest so we can pass 
these details on. Sign ups will be a first-come, first-served basis.

Please note that although the sessions will go ahead at the same time, they **must** remain separate so as to comply 
with current guidelines, and members are expected to follow social distancing measures.

Entry is **Â£3 cash only** on the door. If you sign up and are unable to attend please let us know. We do not want the 
place to go to waste, and we do not want Longford Park track to lose out on takings, especially in the current climate.

## Non-track speedwork sessions

For these alternative non-track speedwork sessions, you will need some sort of timing device
and some landmarks to run between, such as trees, park benches, etc. The sessions 
have times for which you should aim to run between these two markers. As part of 
your warm up, make a mental note of your starting landmark then time yourself 
doing an easyish run/jog for the stated time: whichever landmark you get when the
time has elapsed is your end marker. Use these two markers for the rest of the 
session.

As always, please remember to stay mindful of your health and safety and that of
those around you.
