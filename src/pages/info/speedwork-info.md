## Session Format

Our track sessions are always on Tuesday, 6:45pm at Manchester Regional Arena. We will start with a few warm up laps and dynamic stretches before going in to the main session.

Entry is discounted to £3.20 for running club members, and there is a further discount to £2.85 for those who live in the Manchester City Council area.

## Joining a Tuesday Speedwork Session

Just turn up, that's all you need. You don't have to be a member. You don't have to have run with us before. You only need to pay entry to the arena.

Meet us inside Manchester Regional ARena at 6:45pm ready to run and you will be welcome to join us. When inside the arena, **look for the people in our black kit, with white and red stripes.**
