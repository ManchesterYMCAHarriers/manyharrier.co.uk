## Information for sessions taking place at the track

To join a session, it is imperative you sign up beforehand as we will need to manage attendance as well as supply the 
track with a list of attendees prior to the session. Therefore, please sign up for sessions the day before they are 
due to take place so we can pass these details on. Sign ups will be a first-come, first-served basis.

Please note that members are expected to follow social distancing measures.

Entry is **Â£3 cash only** on the door. If you sign up and are unable to attend please let us know. We do not want the 
place to go to waste, and we do not want Longford Park track to lose out on takings, especially in the current climate.
