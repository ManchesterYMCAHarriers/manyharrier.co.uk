## Session format

For these alternative speedwork sessions, you will need some sort of timing device
and some landmarks to run between, such as trees, park benches, etc. The sessions 
have times for which you should aim to run between these two markers. As part of 
your warm up, make a mental note of your starting landmark then time yourself 
doing an easyish run/jog for the stated time: whichever landmark you get when the
time has elapsed is your end marker. Use these two markers for the rest of the 
session.

As always, please remember to stay mindful of your health and safety and that of
those around you.
