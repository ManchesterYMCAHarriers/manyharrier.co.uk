# Session format

We will start the formal session at 7:00pm with some dynamic stretches - do a 
couple of warm up laps if you're ready before this. We will then do the main 
session. Afterwards, we will do a couple of easy laps to cool down and then some 
easy stretching.

Speedwork sessions are meant to be hard; you will need to push yourself, but 
you'll also get plenty of encouragement and support from everyone! We know that 
some people are faster than others, so our speedwork sessions are designed to be 
accessible to all abilities.
