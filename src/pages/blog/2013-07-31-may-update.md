## May 2013

May saw some Harriers taking a break after their marathon exploits but with all to play for in the championships the racing continued

### Road
The Morecambe Half Marathon was the first long run of the championship on Sunday 12 May. After a bright start the weather quickly turned to provide a cold and very wet finish for the Harriers who had braved the seaside to run the 13.1 miles. Mark Griffiths was the first Harrier home followed by Rob Kedian, Jon Paramour, Emma Parkin, Steph Goodchild, Mike O’Brien and then Steve Symons on the comeback trail ably supported by Miranda Clarke

Then on Wednesday 15 May the first of the Horwich 5 series took place. There was a surprisingly large field for the event and the Harriers put in a sterling performance. The route for this event is a little hilly but very pretty and well worth a mid-week trip. With 3 more races to go in the series, we’d encourage everyone to turn out and take part. So far the standings are; Thomas Hyde, Mark Griffiths, Rob Kedian, Mike O’Brian and Steve Symons for the men and Emma Parkin and Steph Goodchild for the ladies.

### Track
The 800m was held on 28 May. This was the second race of the track championship and while no one managed as quick a time as David Rudisha the race did see a number of PB’s being achieved with the trophies going to Thomas Hyde for the men and Emma Bedford for the ladies

### Fell
The first two races of the fell championship were held in May; the Cake Race on Saturday 4th May and Vanessa Chapel on 22nd May. Both races had a great turn out from the club and it was fantastic to see a lot of first time fell runners from the club coming down to the races and performing so well at both events.

Clearly the promise of free cake had a galvanising effect on Mark Griffiths and Hannah Brierley who came home 1st for the club at the Cake Race. For the men the results were, Mark, Mike Symons, James Gu, Ian Manners and Steve Symons. For the ladies Hannah, Emma Parkin and Miranda Clarke.

For full details of all the runners and times from all the races please see the results pages
