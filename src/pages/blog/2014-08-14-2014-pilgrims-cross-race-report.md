## Report

Despite the weather warnings the rain held off for an enjoyable if slightly windy fell race. The varied course and fast downhill finish helped encourage some pleasing runs and exciting sprint finishes.

Well done to Mark Griffiths for finishing first Harrier just ahead of Richard Brierley in his first fell race. Richard’s run was particularly fine since he ran the muddy course and rocky downhill trails in road shoes!

David Ashton and Stephen Symons continued their close battle for championship points with David just edging out Symo. Just behind them were Miranda, Rob, Hannah and then Emma. The long downhill finish made for an exciting end to the race. There were no smiles or waves to the crowd this time with all 4 Harriers sprinting hard for the line.
