The first cross country race of the season on Saturday 19 October 2013 proved a great success for the Harriers.

The opening race for MACCL was held at Heaton Park on a beautiful sunny afternoon with a fantastic turn out of 15 runners for the Club. Mark Griffiths and Hannah Brierly came home first for the men and ladies teams and the full results are available on the link below

As well as an outstanding performance on the course we also managed to get the tent down in record time!
