The second race of the Cross Country season took place on Sunday 10 November at Woodbank Park. Heavy rain the day before made for a wet and muddy course but the glorious sunshine on the day more than made up for it!

Despite a shoelace malfunction Hannah Brierley came home first for the ladies team in 39:33 (remember – double or triple tie those laces!) followed by Emma Rettig (40:19), Steph Goodchild (40:39) and Emma Bedford (41:56). It would be fantastic to for the Club to be able to field a bigger ladies team, so dust off your spikes and hopefully see you at the next race!

The men’s race saw a fantastic turnout for the Harriers and the return of David Garner who came home first for the Club in 41:33. David was followed by Mark Griffiths (42:59), Chris March (44:32), Richard Brailsford (47:12), Rob Kedian (48:48), James Gu (51:48), Paul Cooper (53:47), Steve Symons (55:35), Jon Paramor (55:42), Geoff Cotterill (57:14) and Ian Manners (59:11)
