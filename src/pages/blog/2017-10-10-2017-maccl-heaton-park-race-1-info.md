## Course map

## Race details
**The women's race starts at 1:30pm** and is three laps (ABCEFGHIJ -> BCEFGHIJ -> BCEFGHIJ -> Finish) - it's the same as the men's route, except the women get to miss out on the joys of the barren wasteland that is the "Papal Field"!

**The men's race starts at 2:30pm** and is three large laps (ABCDEFGHIJ -> BCDEFGHIJ -> BCDEFGHIJ -> Finish).

## Race numbers
Race numbers will be collected by a member of the committee and distributed before the race. **Remember to keep your race number safe - you will need the same number for all Manchester Area League events this winter!**

## No entries on the day
The Manchester Area League are no longer accepting entries on the day of the event - if you haven't signed up for our cross country championships this year but want to take part, please [get in touch](/contact)!

## Travel

### By car
There are various car parks available - it will cost Â£1.50 to park.

The nearest car park to the start/finish can be accessed through the St Margaret's Road entrance (M25 2GT). There is another car park off the A576 Middleton Road, which is about a 10-minute walk away from the start/finish, and another car park off the A6044 Sheepfoot Lane, which is about a 15-minute walk from the start/finish.

### By tram
The nearest tram stop is [Heaton Park](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/heaton-park-tram), which is on Bury Old Road. If you're traveling from Manchester city centre, catch the Bury service.

It is a 10-15 minute walk to the start/finish area. From the tram stop, cross the road and enter the park through the gates, then head straight until you come to a T-junction.  Turn left here - the start/finish area is at the top of the hill on the right-hand side.

### By bus
[The nearest bus stop is next to the tram stop on Bury Old Road](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/stops/1800NC41741/135).  The 135 runs regularly from Piccadilly Gardens.
