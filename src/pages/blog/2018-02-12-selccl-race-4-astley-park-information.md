</address>

**The women's race starts at 1:40pm** and is around four-and-a-half to five miles in distance.

## Race numbers
If you ran at the South East Lancs races at Heaton Park, Tandle Hill or Leigh, remember to bring your race number along with you! Otherwise, you can collect you race number from a member of the committee before the race.  (These are the numbers that *don't* have a blue or pink strip on them!)

## Travel

### By car
Leave the M61 at Junction 8 and then follow the signs for Chorley town centre. When you reach a small roundabout next to Halfords, take the second exit (signposted Euxton A581). This road leads to various car parks that are a short walk from where the race starts and finishes in Astley Park:

* Queens Road (102 spaces) - **PR7 1JX**
* Farrington Street (51 spaces) - **PR7 1DY**
* Flat Iron (170 spaces) - **PR7 1SL**

These car parks are all free to use after 1:00pm.

For more information on these and other car parks in Chorley, visit [Chorley Council's parking page](http://chorley.gov.uk/Pages/AtoZ/Parking.aspx).

_Note that the brown signs for Astley Hall (and the postcode on the address) will take you to the other side of the park, which is a bit more of a walk to the start and finish area!_

### By public transport
The train would normally be the best method of public transport to get from Manchester to Chorley, however there is a rail replacement bus service in operation every weekend until July 2018 - this means the journey will take a lot longer.  See the [National Rail Enquiries journey planner](http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/Manchester/CRL/170218/1300/arr/170218/1530/dep) for more information.
