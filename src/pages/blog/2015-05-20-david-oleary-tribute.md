It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of our fellow Harrier and ex-President, David O’Leary. He fought a long battle with cancer and will be remembered as a life long member, runner and contributor to the YMCA Harriers.

On a very personal level he participated in some legendary events, such as the Ben Nevis fell race and the Isle of Man 40. He was inspirational in organising road races like the YMCA 125, the Hyde 7, the YMCA Joggers Marathon and our very own YMCA race, now known as Blackleach.

Wherever you go and run and people hear you are YMCA, they always ask, “do you know Dave O’Leary?” He is and will always be a YMCA legend.

Our deepest condolences go to his wife Jean and family.
