Calling all members! We've got some news about an exciting new cup competition that promises to add a little bit of extra excitement, and an element of intra-club competition to your weekly parkrun activities!

**What is it?**

A handicapped knockout cup competition commencing in August (date TBC)

**Where is it?**

Parkrun locations to be agreed with your competitor

**How does it work?**

Names will be drawn from a hat to compete against each other at parkrun.  The winner progresses to the round, and so on until the cup winner is determined in a final round.

**What if I'm drawn against a faster runner?**

There will be a handicapping system to give everyone a fair and equal chance of winning.  When you submit your entry for the competition, we'll also ask you to submit your fastest parkrun time this year.  When the two competitors race against each other at parkrun on the day, the difference between their submitted PBs will be added to the faster runner's time and the winner will be the one with the fastest time, after the handicap has been added.  Simple!

**How many rounds will there be?**

This will depend on the number of entries, but for example if there are 32 entrants we'll need 5 rounds.

**Which parkrun will we race at?**

This is entirely up to the competitors to decide between them.  It may be nice for as many of the matches to be held at the same parkrun on the same day but we know this may not always be possible. 

**When should we hold our matches?**

We'll provide a window in which matches will need to be completed, in order to keep the competition progressing.  Again it may be nice to hold all of the matches on the same day but again we appreciate that this isn't always possible so it will be for the competitors to decide the date between them.

**What next?**

If you'd like to enter, please [get in touch with Rachel Meredith](mailto:hello@manyharrier.co.uk?subject=parkrun%20cup) to register your entry.  Don't forget to also include your fastest parkrun time of 2019.  Rach will collate the entries, and draw the names to set up the fixtures.  We'll post the fixtures on the club website and notify you when they're ready to view, and when you should complete your match by.  We'll aim to start the competition on the first weekend in August.

Good luck everybody!
