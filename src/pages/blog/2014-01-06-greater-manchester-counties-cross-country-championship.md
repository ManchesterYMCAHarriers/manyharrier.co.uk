The Greater Manchester Counties Cross Country Championships took place on Saturday 4th January 2014 at Leigh. The course was flat, fast(ish depending on how many mince pies were eaten over the festive period) and apart from a few sticky bits, not too muddy. The organisation and marshalling on the day was fantastic and once again the rain held off, making for some lovely running conditions.

As usual the ladies lined up first. It was a small field of only 43 runners and the ladies from Leigh Harriers cleaned up taking the top four spots. The results for our team were;

1.	Hannah Brierley – 30.02
2.	Emma Rettig – 33.05
3.	Emma Bedford – 33.50
4.	Jen Delaney – 52.04

The men’s race attracted much better numbers with 120 runners taking part. The published times don’t appear to be correct and will be updated here once confirmed as accurate however the places for the Club were as follows;

1.	Chris March
2.	Rob Kedian
3.	Paul Cooper
4.	James Gu
5.	Jon Paramor
6.	Steve Symons
7.	Geoff Cotterill

I think I can safely say that the Club provide the most vocal support for the runners and the ladies cheer squad was greatly enhanced with the addition of pom-poms courtesy of Jen Delaney!

Next race is MACCL at Boggart Hole Clough on Sunday 12 January – for everyone taking part, be prepared for the mud!
