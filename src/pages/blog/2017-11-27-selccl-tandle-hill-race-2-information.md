**The women's race starts at 1:40pm** and is around four-and-a-half to five miles in distance.

**The men's race starts at 2:20pm** and is around six miles in distance.

## Race numbers
If you ran at the first South East Lancs race at Heaton Park, remember to bring your race number along with you! Otherwise, you can collect you race number from a member of the committee before the race.

**Remember to keep your race number safe - you will need the same number for all South East Lancs Cross Country League events this winter!**
