The cross country season is nearly upon us so here’s a bit of information about what it entails…

## What is it?

The Wikipedia definition is sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain. Essentially, this is the winter off-road sport in which we compete not only individually but also as a club.

In cross country the men and women run in separate races with different start times.

## Who do we compete with?

We usually compete in 2 leagues – the Greater Manchester League and the South East Lancs League. However, this year we are yet to hear if South East Lancs League will go ahead. The Manchester League as you might expect is made up of a number of local clubs (as well as some slightly less local ones) so it’s a good chance to see what everyone else is doing.

There are also single Greater Manchester, Northern and National championship races where we compete with clubs in the north and across the country.

## How are we ranked?

To complete the Manchester league you must run 4 of the 5 races. You will then be given an individual ranking in the league comprised of your best 4 results.

We also compete as team. To have a qualifying men’s team we need 6 runners for a race. For a qualifying women’s team it’s 4 runners. The top runners per race will count towards the team and an overall position on the day.

As with the individual rankings, we need to have fielded a team in 4 of the 5 races to qualify for a position overall.

So even if you don’t plan to finish the league it’s good to turn up to the races you can do as you may help contribute to one of the team places.

## What about the club championship?

We also hold a club championship for members to compete with each other. The usual trophies for the top 6 women and top 6 men are available. The championship is scored in the same way as the road and fell.

To qualify you need to complete 4 of 7 possible races. The qualifying races this year are the 5 Manchester league races, the Northern Championships and the National Championships.

## Where is it?

The races are in local parks around Manchester. This year’s locations are Woodbank Park (Stockport), Sherdley Park (St Helens), Boggart Hole Clough (Blackley), Heaton Park and Wythenshawe Park.

The races are hosted by local clubs. As the Harriers do not host a race (many of the clubs don’t) we are usually asked to provide a few marshals for one of the races.

The venue for the Northern champs is yet to be confirmed but the National will be at Parliament Hill in London!

## What is the terrain?

Expect mud, mud and more mud. The races tend to be over grass and through wooded areas with some up and down sections (nothing like a fell race – just undulating).

## How far is it?

The women usually run between 4-6 miles and the men between 5-7 miles. For the National and the Northern the distances are slightly longer.

## When are the races?

11 October 2014 – Woodbank Park
8 November 2014 – Sherdley Park
6 December 2014 – Boggart Hole Clough
7 January 2015 – Heaton Park
24 January 2014 – Northern Champs, Venue TBC
7 February 2015 – Wythenshawe Park
21 February 2015 – National Champs, Parliament Hill
We are also hoping for a men and women’s team for the Manchester University Cross Country Relays on 25 October 2014. Date for Greater Manchester Champs is TBC, it’s usually the first weekend of January.

## What time does it start?

For the Manchester League the women’s race starts at 1.40pm and the men’s race at 2.30pm.

## What kit do I need?

As I have mentioned there is quite a lot of mud involved! Ideally, it would be wise to invest in some cross country spikes. These are lightweight shoes with spikes for grip in the mud. They tend to be cheaper than a normal running shoe – you can pick up a pair for between £30-£50.

If you haven’t got spikes at the very least you need a pair of trainers with good grip such as a trail or fell shoe. What you wear clothing wise will depend on how much you like the cold!

It is advisable to bring some waterproof shoes/wellies, lots of warm clothes and a waterproof coat to wrap up in for before and after the race. We encourage the women to support the men once they have finished and vice versa. This is part of the fun but it can get cold when you are standing around cheering.

Snacks and chocolate are also greatly appreciated when shared with your fellow runners!

## How do I enter?

There is a sign-up sheet on the board for those who wish to participate. The club has to pay an affiliation fee to the league by the end of the month so the deadline to sign up is 18 September 2014.

The fee is £20 which covers your entry to all the Manchester League races, the Northern and the National. It’s then up to you which ones you want to do but we hope people will come to as many as possible.

## Questions?

If you have any questions at all about cross country please speak to me or Mark at one of the training nights and we will be happy to answer any queries.
