It might not feel like it given the current weather conditions, but Spring will soon be upon us. The final cross country races are drawing near and we are looking forward to a new running season.

Here are a few reminders/details of what’s going on over the coming months.

### Marathon Training

Now in full swing with long runs going at 10am from the Y club on Sunday. Usually two groups with regular looping points to catch up. Mark has put together a helpful training plan with details of the long runs.

If you are targeting a specific time and want a more bespoke training plan Steve Symons can help put one together for you.

You don’t need to be training for a marathon, if you have a distant event coming up or just fancy a long run please do feel free to join us.

### Central Lancs Grand Prix

The first race of the Grand Prix is the Central Lancashire 5K on 15 February 2015, hosted by Bolton Harriers. I know we keep saying it but we are really keen for Harriers to support the races given the support we had in September for Blackleach. Check out the Central Lancashire GP website for full list of all the fixtures.

If you fancy a new challenge why not aim to complete the league and race others at local clubs. The Grand Prix produce a league table, you need to complete 7 out of 10 races to qualify. Remember Harriers cannot compete in our own race at Blackleach Park, which forms one of the 10 (we need the marshalls!).

### Road & Fell Championships

The fixtures have now been circulated. The first road race, the Trafford 10k, is on 8 March 2015; unfortunately, the race is already full!

Remember, you need 6 of 10 to complete the road (or 5 plus a marathon) and 5 of 9 for the fell. Within your qualifying races you must have a short, medium and long.

### Track

Going strong as ever and run by Steve. If you haven’t been before and fancy giving it a go please do let one of us know – fun, fast sessions catering to all abilities.

The track championship also takes place over summer with trophies awarded to the winners of all races. Not taken too seriously, we are not very good at sprinting.

### Kit

If you need anything please see Mark Griffiths.

### Membership Renewal

Coming up as usual in May 2015. Information will be circulated in due course but FYI England Athletics have increased their fees again.

If you are a social member of the Y club, you can now pay by monthly direct debit of £5 a month.

### New Members

We love to see them so please do bring anyone you know who is interested in running along to one of the sessions.

### Feedback

If you have any suggestions/queries/comments please do speak to one of the committee – we welcome all feedback.

Wishing you all a successful summer season.
