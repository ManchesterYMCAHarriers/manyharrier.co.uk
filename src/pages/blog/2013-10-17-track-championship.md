A record breaking turnout of seventeen runners turned out for the final track race of the season in the Manchester YMCA Harriers Mile Championship on 10 September. Many thanks go to Simon Goodchild for time-keeping on this one and he was kept very busy with quite a number of close battles right through the whole field. Phil Pennall running as a guest but now I am pleased to say has rejoined was a clear winner coming home first with a sub five minute finish. Mark and Chris once again had a close battle with Mark just edging out Chris who ran another new pb to take the trophy and also secure the overall men’s track championship for 2013. Rob Kedian dipped under six minutes just ahead of Lee Dunn who just missed out on a sub six by one second. With Hannah Brierley the only one who could stop Kelly from taking the title and unable to run this meant Kelly came home first for the women and in doing so took the overall women’s track title for 2013. Next there was a very close battle between Richard, Brian, and Chris Tyson with just four seconds between them all. Sandwiched in between Brian and Chris it was a welcome back to the track for Bec Avanessian.
Emma Rettig was next home in a new PB of 6.43 closely followed by Steve Symons who was very pleased to dip under the 7 minute barrier for first time this year. Olivia Scates was next home and another one with a new PB of 7.13 just one second ahead of Steph Goodchild, who just edged out Jon Paramor. Ruselle Meade ran a great effort and narrowly missed setting a new PB by just a few seconds.
Jenny Delaney was next home and capped off a very successful few weeks with a third Pb in as many weeks clocking 9.05.

Congratulations to everyone for turning out and making this the most exciting track race we have had for a very long time.
