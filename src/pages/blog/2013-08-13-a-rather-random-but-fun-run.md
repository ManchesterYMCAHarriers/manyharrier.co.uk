On a warm Wednesday night in August, 12 Harriers line up at the bridge by the Lowry Theatre. It must have been a strange sight to the theatre goers and shoppers but we didn’t care, we were here to race!

Our President, Steve Symons (aka “the King”) had devised a 5.25 mile route around the Quays / Media City to replace the Saddleworth 6. There was a great turn out from the Club and some very quick times were posted.

Mark Griffiths won the race closely followed by Neil Stephenson who gave him a real run for his money. A further battle was fought by Mike O’Brien and Hannah Brierley with Hannah making it over the line first. Emma Rettig and Geoff Cotterill sprinted it out for the finish with Emma just managing to stay ahead (all those track sessions have clearly worked!). Richard Belcher and Brian Glenriffe ran another close race making it very exciting for all at the finish.

Full results are;

Mark Griffiths – 32.43
Neil Stephenson – 33.59
Rob Kedian – 34.44
James Gu – 37.18
Hannah Brierley – 38.34
Mike O’Brien – 38.54
Emma Parkin – 40.01
Geoff Cotterill – 40.02
Brian Glenriffe – 40.48
Richard Belcher – 40.52
Steve Symons – 42.54
Jon Paramour – 47.54

The race was such a success that we are considering making it a quarterly event. Watch this space for details of the next one
