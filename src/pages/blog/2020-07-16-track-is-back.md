We are delighted to announce that as of Tuesday 4th August we will once again be able to offer track sessions for our 
Manchester YMCA Harriers.

Like our current Thursday Groups, these sessions will look a little different to usual. There will be two sessions, both 
at the time of **6.15pm** at [Longford Park track](/venues/longford-park-stadium). In keeping with Government, England 
Athletics and Longford Park guidelines, these sessions can hold a **maximum of 6 people**. To join a session, it is 
imperative you sign up beforehand as we will need to manage attendance as well as supply the track with a list of 
attendees prior to the session. Therefore, please sign up for sessions by Monday morning at the latest so we can pass 
these details on. [You can sign up via the event page of the website](/events) and it will be a first-come, first-served
basis.

Please note that although the sessions will go ahead at the same time, they **must** remain separate so as to comply 
with current guidelines, and members are expected to follow social distancing measures.

The two sessions will continue at Longford Park at 6.15pm on Tuesdays with a maximum of 6 participants, until further 
notice.

Entry is **£3 cash only** on the door. If you sign up and are unable to attend please let us know. We do not want the 
place to go to waste, and we do not want Longford Park track to lose out on takings, especially in the current climate.

We can’t wait to see you there!
