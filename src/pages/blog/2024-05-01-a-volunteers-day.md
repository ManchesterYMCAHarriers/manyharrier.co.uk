Having experienced a running career from 1964 until 2020 one can appreciate that, like work retirement, it is essential 
to have something to fill the void. For myself this has been volunteering at club athletic events.

Both as a runner and volunteer one particular race stands above all others: The Manx Mountain Marathon - where the 
connection goes back over thirty years.

The race is 31 and a half miles long with 8,000-feet of ascent covered by twelve summit checkpoints. It is truly a 
classic, offering coastal paths, rugged ascents and descents and woodland plantations. However, the magic of this 
event lies in the atmosphere generated through excellent organisation and comradeship experiences.

By highlighting in chronological order a volunteer's day, I'll endeavour to show how the magical race experience 
equally applies to this role.

6am pick up outside the Guest House in Douglas by Tony Rowley. (Tony and Richie Stevenson have become close 
colleagues over the whole of this period both as race rivals and an established friendship.) From here we drive out to 
Ramsey where the race commences placing **CAUTION RUNNERS** signs at critical road junctions.

Next stop: Tony opening-up at Race Headquarters:

Once inside preparations begin: tables, chairs, registration, kit check area, etc. (Helping with the latter was my 
job here):

Two photographs which I hope will relate to readers the buzz and tension of a pre-race:

Next job marshalling a road crossing early in the race. Interestingly, the race winner has already established a clear 
lead. Once all runners have passed we collect the **CAUTION RUNNERS** signs before heading to the critical road 
crossing on the Mountain Road of the T-T course:

From here we head to the race finish area via the Round Table checkpoint where a water station is erected. I must 
just deviate somewhat here to describe the banter we enjoy every year at this part of the day. Families, football, 
race experiences, etc. are all covered in detail to a backdrop of 60's pop classics on the radio.

Arriving at the finish in Port Erin we stop for a lunch break - out from one of Tony's bags comes: coffee, sandwiches, 
fruit, and snacks which continue to appear for the rest of the day.

After this we split forces. Tony goes out to flag the race run-in which is a designated route, whilst my role is 
helping set up the finishing area.

Working with Richard Rose throughout the afternoon doing a second number check, giving out slate memento coasters 
and bandannas before directing to complimentary Bushy's beer and T-shirts.

Three photographs which hopefully will give an example of the atmosphere generated by all, and experiences shared once 
the race is completed. This is enhanced by the spectacular scenery across Port Erin Bay:

Once deadline time is up a very welcome meal is enjoyed followed by presentations.


Packing away time following a long but rewarding day before an 8pm drop off back at the Guest House. (As an aside - 
following the 14-hour day, the thought of losing an hour's sleep due to the clocks going forward was not the most 
welcoming of prospects!)

Before ending this blog, I need to emphasise that my volunteering role was solely for race day. An awareness and 
appreciation must go to all the preparation that goes into pre- and post-race organisation.
