The first long run of the fell championship took place on Saturday 10 August in the glorious Peak District. It was a good day to be out on the fells and 4 Harriers bravely turned out for the ½ Tour of Bradwell.

The route was fantastic, a few big climbs but a very runnable course which took you through some spectacular scenery. Despite some initial concerns, the route was well marked with excellent written instructions from the organisers. Although the final stretch to the finish was a little confusing and lead more than one person going slightly off route. The event was very well organised with drinks, sweets and bananas available at some of the checkpoints to keep you fuelled and hydrated along with hot drinks and savoury treats at the finish. Overall it was great race and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it on the Championship calendar in the future.

Results for the 16 mile race are;
Stephanie Goodchild – 2.58.08
Emma Rettig – 3.14.50
Steve Symons – 3.14.54
Mike O’Brien – 3.32.29
