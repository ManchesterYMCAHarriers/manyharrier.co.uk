</address>

**The women's race starts at 1:40pm** and is around four-and-a-half to five miles in distance.

**The men's race starts at 2:20pm** and is around six miles in distance.

## Race numbers
If you ran at the South East Lancs races at Heaton Park or Tandle Hill, remember to bring your race number along with you! Otherwise, you can collect you race number from a member of the committee before the race.  (These are the numbers that *don't* have a blue or pink strip on them!)

**Remember to keep your race number safe - you will need the same number for the final South East Lancs Cross Country League event in February!**

## Travel

### By car
There are large car parks near the venue. The postcode to use for "Sat Navs" is **WN7 4JY** - but turn left up Turner Way (beside The Whistling Wren pub) to get to the closest car park.

### By public transport
The [V1 bus service](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/routes/v1-manchester) is the best choice to get you to Leigh from Manchester City Centre; the services are frequent and fast (using the Leigh Guided Busway).  From Leigh Bus Station, it is about a 15 minute walk to the venue.
