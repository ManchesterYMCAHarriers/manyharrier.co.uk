An amazing turn-out of thirteen members took part in the toughest of the track races, the 10,000m last night.

Again a close battle between Mark and Chris provided an exciting race up the front with Mark taking top honours sprinting away on the last lap to win by just four seconds. Rob Kedian and Sean Bennett also had a close finish with just nine seconds separating them in Robs favour. Hannah Brierley took the women’s title coming home first ahead of Kelly Ormesher who was just thirteen seconds ahead of Brian Glenriffe. Jon Paramor pushed hard over last few laps and managed to hold off Stephen Symons by just two seconds. Next home was Chris Tyson ahead of Steph Goodchild. Rushelle Meade was next home followed by Jenny Delaney who was delighted at the end to have set a new PB.

This has now also set up an exciting end to the track season for 2013 with the Mile next week with a number of trophies and positions yet to be settled. Congratulations to go Mark Griffiths who has cannot be stopped from becoming overall track champion for 2013. However it still leaves Chris March, Rob Kedian, Steve Symons and Brian Glenriffe to battle it out for the next four places. In the women’s its an even tighter end to the season with both Hannah Brierley and Kelly Ormesher able to secure the overall track champions title with a win in the mile. Steph Goodchild, Olivia Scates and Rushelle Meade can also complete the overall track competition and again results from the mile can influence final finishing positions for the season.

Finally a massive thank-you goes to Simon Goodchild who had the very difficult task of lap counting 25 laps each for thirteen runners last night and recording the finish times. Thanks again, I am sure everyone will agree with me in saying Simon does a brilliant job for us.
