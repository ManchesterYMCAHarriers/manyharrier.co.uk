## June 2013

June was a very busy month for the Harriers with the championships in full swing. There have been some fantastic performances, perhaps most notably on the track where the sprints were edge of your seat viewing!

Our Club Secretary also got married and became Emma Rettig. Our congratulations to Emma and Jonathan!

### Road
There were three races for the road championship in June. The Dunham Massey 5k kicked off the month in blazing sunshine making for a very hot, fast run. The second Horwich 5 series was held with a number of Harriers making their second attempt at the race and in complete contrast to the start of the month, the Sotos 10k brought winds, rain and crashing waves to the event.
### Track
June was the month of sprints with the 100m and 200m taking place on 11 June and 400m taking place on 26 June.

Kelly Ormesher has taken the “queen of the sprints” crown for the ladies. The competition was fierce with some strong challenges from Hannah Brierley but Kelly has taken 1st place in all three events.
The men’s races were real nail biters with Chris March taking 1st place for 100m and Mark Griffiths claiming 1st place for the 200m and 400m. They were extremely closely fought runs with Thomas Hyde and Neil Stephenson making strong challenges for positions as well

### Fell
The fell championship goes from strength to strength and June saw 2 more events taking place; Sutton Pinnacle on 16 June and Langley Fete on 30 June.

Sutton Pinnacle saw some great performances including Mark Griffiths who finished 7th overall in a strong field and Hannah Brierley who was 3rd lady overall. Steph Goodchild continues to be an inspiration to all on the fells with her “diesel” power and Mike O’Brien also ran a great race.

Langley Fete was short sharp race and the Club made up quite a large portion of the field – it was great to see so many vests out! Thomas Hyde put in an outstanding performance to come 3rd overall. Tom was closely followed by Mark Griffiths and then Hannah Brierley who was the 3rd overall lady. James Gu came in behind Hannah with Steph Goodchild managing to hold off Steve Symons. Mike O’Brien came in after Steve with Emma Rettig last home for the Club.
