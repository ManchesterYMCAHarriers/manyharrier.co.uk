## Welsh Castles (8-9 June)

Once again we entered a team in to the ever popular Welsh Castles Relay. For anyone who isn’t familiar with the race it’s a 2 day, 20 stage, 211 mile, staggered relay race (mostly on road, but with many hills, mountains and bumpy bits on route – this being Wales and all…).
The route goes from Caernarfon to Cardiff with an overnight stay in Newtown. An excellent team effort all round from all the runners saw the Harriers finish 38th Overall out of 61 teams and 25th overall in the open division. As anyone who has taken part knows there is some tough competition in the event and the result is a real testament to the strength and depth we have at the club – well done to everyone who took part!
A big thank-you also has to go to the non runner helpers who also came down and helped out on the weekend with our allocated marshalling points and support of all the runners.
