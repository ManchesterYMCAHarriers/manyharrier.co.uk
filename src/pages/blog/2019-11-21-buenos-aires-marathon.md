Argentina and in particular Buenos Aires had been a place that I'd longed to 
visit ever since watching grainy videos of the 1978 World Cup as a football 
mad youngster.  Friends who had been had told exciting tales of their adventures
 in the city known as the Paris of South America, and so when I was researching 
 autumn race and holiday destinations and found out that there was a September 
 marathon in Buenos Aires, my search was over.

As I stood on the start line on the morning of the race however, my nerves were 
high but expectations were low.  My training had gone well over the summer, and 
the weather conditions were perfect on the day, but experience from previous 
races told me that the combination of a long journey, jet lag, time zone 
differences, and a very early race start (7am for this one), have previously 
made it difficult for me to run at my best in those circumstances.  To compound 
matters, since arriving in Buenos Aires 3 days earlier, my diet had pretty much 
consisted exclusively of enormous steaks, and I had of course sampled a glass or 
two of the famous Argentinian Malbec.  This wasn't the carb loading preparation 
which is advised in all the literature.  I had always wanted to watch a live 
football match in Argentina, and so on the night before the race I got the 
chance to tick this off my bucket list by watching the famous Boca Juniors play, 
and whilst it was without doubt the fantastic experience I'd hoped it would be, 
it meant that I didn't get back to my apartment until almost midnight – hours 
later than I should really have been asleep on the night before a race.  In one 
final twist, after finally getting to sleep and with the alarm set for 4.30am, 
the neighbouring apartment decided to have a very loud and very wild party 
starting at 1.30am.  So after managing only a couple of hours' sleep, to say I 
was concerned that my race prep was less than ideal would have been an 
understatement!  However as with most races, once I was stood on the start line, 
I decided that my plan was to set off at close to PB pace and then adjust later 
on depending on how I was feeling.  In for a penny, in for pound – I may as well 
have a go for it after travelling all that way!

As the gun went off, I tried to settle into the race but for the first 5k or so 
the course was quite undulating and I wasn't feeling as comfortable as I would 
normally expect to be so early on.  I was behind my target pace and my legs were 
feeling heavy.  My fears about the less than ideal race prep and the 
difficulties of foreign races felt like they were about to spectacularly come to
fruition.  Because of this I didn't push too hard in the initial stages, and by
10k I found myself in a group of about 15 runners that had broken away from 
the main crowds, but I was starting to get dropped as the rest of the pack had 
picked up  their pace and were slowly pulling away from me.  I had to make a 
quick decision; should I push on with them and risk blowing up spectacularly 
due to going out too fast, or should I back off, play safe and try to battle 
on alone? I looked back and there didn't seem to be anyone in sight behind to 
run with so I decided to gamble and put on a burst to bridge the gap back to 
the group and tucked in behind them, in the hope that they would pull me along 
whilst I settled into the race.   This is a tactic I often try to use in races - 
I find that locking in with a group who are running close to the right pace 
is far easier than trying to set the pace alone for the duration of the race.  

The miles ticked by and even though the group were pushing on a little faster 
than I was intending to go, I was starting to feel better as the race went 
on, and I got through the halfway point in 1 hour 18mins.  If I could do the 
same again it would be good enough for a PB.  However there was still a long 
way to go, and I was still worried about whether I could sustain the pace as 
in most races previously I'd suffered with cramp in the later stages which 
had caused my pace to fall away towards the end.   Doing another 1.18 half 
marathon was going to be a tough ask.  Despite this though, I was feeling 
far more comfortable than earlier on in the race, and it was also the first 
point that I'd spotted my support crew of Brierley brothers; Ric and Andy, 
which gave me a massive boost as they cheered me on.  A couple of miles later 
at mile 15, and after spotting the boys one more time my confidence was 
starting to build - my legs were no longer feeling heavy, and the pace was 
feeling good despite the fact that the splits were well under target pace by 
this point.  Whilst feeling good at mile 15 can sometimes be a false dawn, 
and with so long still to go it would generally be unwise to get carried away 
at this point, I'd not felt this fresh in a race before at this stage; so I 
felt it was my time to take a turn at the front of the group and push us all 
on.

Whilst I wasn't able to exchange many words with my new running mates who were 
largely sporting vests from Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, there was an 
unmistakable camaraderie between us as we carried each other along, each taking 
turns on the front like cyclists in a peloton.  It felt like we were getting 
carried along by a relentless wave of momentum as we caught up with and swept 
past countless runners ahead of us in the field – it was a great feeling!  

As we ran through the famous La Boca area of Buenos Aires at mile 18, our 
little pack started to break up as some fell off the pace, and our numbers 
started to dwindle until by mile 20 there was only two of us left, me and a 
Brazilian runner dressed all in black, running side by side.  We were already 
motoring along, far quicker than I had ever managed at this stage of a race 
before, but I felt him pick up the pace still further on my shoulder, and 
whilst I wouldn't normally even contemplate speeding up at mile 20, my 
breathing was under control and my legs felt strong so I decided to go with him.  
I spotted Ric and Andy one last time at mile 24, gave them a wave and pushed on 
for the finish.  I knew by then that a PB was very much within my grasp barring 
a spectacular disaster, but at that point I started to realise that sub 2.35 
may be possible if I was able to maintain this pace.  

Anyone who has done a long distance race and has tried to do mental arithmetic 
in the later miles as you try to calculate what pace you need to run in order 
to achieve a certain time, will be familiar with the concept of 
‘marathon maths'; but needless to say, by the time you've ran 20+ miles with 
your body and mind about to give up, doing maths is hard.  So I gave up trying 
to work it out and just decided to run as hard as possible to the finish 
instead.  As I negotiated the final bend and saw the finish line, I knew that 
I could do it and summoned up my last ounce of energy for a sprint to the finish 
and crossed the line in 2.34.18 – a 3 minute PB!  I couldn't quite believe that 
my best performance, and the strongest I'd ever felt in a race came despite such 
challenging circumstances - maybe there's something in this steak & Malbec diet 
after all...
