## Travel

### By car
There is plenty of car parking at the venue, however **please do not park on the narrow access road**.

The best postcode to use for "Sat Navs" is **M23 0BD**, however be careful to access the venue using the route described below through Northern Moor - **don't use the bus lane off Princess Parkway.** _(Having done this once in his youth, your correspondent was once pulled over for a chat with a police officer!)_

From the M60, leave at junction 5 and join the A5103 (Princess Parkway) southbound (signs to Wythenshawe). Immediately leave the A5103 to join the B5167. On leaving turn right (this will take you under the A5103) onto the B5167 (Wythenshawe Road).

To get to the sports ground from Wythenshawe Road (B5167) turn left/right coming from the west/east (if you have just left the A5103 itâ€™s a right turn) onto Sale Road (B5166). Take a right off Sale Road onto Yewtree Lane and then left onto Willenhall Road. Continue along Willenhall Road under the motorway. Negotiate a sharp left turn after the motorway underpass and continue along the road to reach the parking area and pavilion.

### By tram
The nearest tram stop is [Northern Moor](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/northern-moor-tram). If you're traveling from Manchester city centre, get to [Deansgate-Castlefield](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/deansgate-castlefield-tram) and then board a Manchester Airport service.

It is about a 15 minute walk to the start/finish area. From the tram stop, head back to Sale Road, cross over and then turn right, heading east. Turn left up Fellpark Road (fourth turn on the left - the road splits around a small semi-circular green), then head to the end of Fellpark Road. Cross over the motorway on the footbridge, then turn right to get to the start area.

### By bus
[The nearest bus stop is on Sale Road/Orton Road](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/stops/1800SB47511/41).  The [41](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/routes/41-manchester) runs regularly from [Piccadilly Gardens](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/stations/manchester-piccadilly-gardens-bus/41).

It is about a 10 minute walk to the start/finish area. From the bus stop, cross over and continue along Sale Road and take the first right up Fellpark Road. Head to the end of Fellpark Road. Cross over the motorway on the footbridge, then turn right to get to the start area.
