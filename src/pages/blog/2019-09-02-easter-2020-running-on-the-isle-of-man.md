Easter on the Isle of Man offers opportunities for every runner combined with a short break on this charming, old-fashioned island.

* **Friday 10th April 2020, 6:45pm**: 10K road race at Port Erin
* **Saturday 11th April 2020, 8:00am**: Manx Mountain Marathon Ultra (31.5 miles) from Ramsey
* **Saturday 11th April 2020, 1:00pm**: Manx Mountain Half Marathon (13.1 miles) at St Johns
* **Saturday 11th April 2020, 2:15pm**: Men's Hill Race (4 miles) at Peel
* **Saturday 11th April 2020, 3:05pm**: Women's Hill Race (3 miles) at Peel
* **Sunday 12th April 2020, 10:30am**: Women's 5K Road Race at Douglas
* **Sunday 12th April 2020, 11:15am**: Men's 5K Road race at Douglas

Runners can stick with one race or enter as many events as they fancy, although I doubt if I would finish the Ultra in time to do the hill race!

The Isle of Man can be reached by ferry from Liverpool or Heysham, or, if you prefer, flights from Manchester. The island is small and easy to navigate and the race organisers help with transport to and from venues - although having use of a car is preferable. Also, car sharing splits the cost of the ferry.

There's lots of Viking history on the Isle of Man and plenty of museums and castles. The island is also blessed with beautiful beaches and abundant wildlife. From the summit of Snaefell (621m), on a clear day, you can see the whole coastline of the island, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales.

There are lots of traditional holiday things to do including the Victorian tramway, the famous Laxey Wheel, crazy golf and tea shops.

2020 will be the 50th anniversary of the Manx Ultra/Mountain Marathon and Iâ€™m determined to be on the start line for this very special event.
