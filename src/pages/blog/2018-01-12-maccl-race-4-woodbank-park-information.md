## Travel

### By car
**Important note:** The junction of St Mary's Way and Hall Lane is closed - the best way of accessing the venue will be via New Zealand Road.  

The league have advised of the following directions to get to the venue by car:

From M60 West take exit J27 then the 3rd exit from the roundabout into
Carrington Road probably signposted B6104 for Hyde or Sheffield.

From M60 East take J26 exit for A560 and at the roundabout take first left into Carrington Road.

At the next traffic lights go straight ahead into New Zealand Road and turn left at the junction at the top of the hill. Follow the road along to the main car park near the Woodbank Community Centre.

You will see the sign on your left for the Woodbank Community Centre –postcode SK1 4BN – turn left into the car park immediately after the Centre. Carry straight on to Woodbank Park’s car park – you’ll have to negotiate what looks like a very tight gap between posts – there’s plenty of room really, it just looks tight! 

There is another small car park (for the adjacent Vernon Park) off Turncroft Lane (nearest postcode is SK1 4AU).

### By train
The nearest train station is [Stockport](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/train/stations/stockport-rail). If you're traveling from Manchester city centre, get to [Manchester Piccadilly](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/train/stations/manchester-piccadilly-rail) - there are lots of services from Piccadilly that call at Stockport!

It is about a 1.5 mile walk from Stockport train station to Woodbank Park.
