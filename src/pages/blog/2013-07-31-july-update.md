## July 2013

### Road
The Rochdale 10k didn’t disappoint this year. Once again it was wet and miserable conditions but this didn’t stop the Harriers from turning out and putting in some great performances. Massive congratulations go to Mark Griffiths who ran a fantastic race and clocked a new PB of 37:53.

The Windmill Half is a new race to the Harriers, it’s a flat and fast course but as it was run on one of the hottest days we’ve experienced for some time, everyone approached it with a note of caution. Well done to James Gu, Geoff Cottril, Steph Goodchild and Steve Symons who donned the sunscreen and turned out for the club.

### Track
There was a break from the track championship in July and given the recent heat wave this was definitely a blessing in disguise!

### Fell
Only one fell championship race in July, but what a race it was! The short sharp Stoodley Pike race was held on a very hot evening in Todmorden. The route was more or less straight up and then straight back down again – hard work with a tricky descent but the views from the top made the effort worthwhile.

Thomas Hyde is finding his fell feet and had a great run coming in first for the Harriers followed by Mark Griffiths, James Gu and Steve Symons

Hannah Brierley continues her winning streak and was the first home for the Harriers ladies followed by Steph Goodchild and Emma Rettig
