This week's group run will be a recce of the Christmas Handicap route, followed by a run to MediaCityUK. We'll start
from outside the Y Club at 6:30pm on 10th December.

Different pace and distance groups will be available depending on numbers of attendees, and in accordance with current
COVID-19 guidance from England Athletics, we can now remove the limit on attendees as long as we have enough group
leaders available, with each leader able to lead sub-groups of 12.

**If you do fancy being a group leader, please don't be shy!** However, please do ensure that you are super familiar
with our [coronavirus group running guidance](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance).

The full route is approximately 7-miles. A shorter alternative route will also be available.
