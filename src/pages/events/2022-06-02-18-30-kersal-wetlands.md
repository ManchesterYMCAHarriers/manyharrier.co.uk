This week's group run will be the Kersal Wetlands route,
starting from outside the Y Club at 6:30pm.

**PLEASE NOTE**: The Y Club is closing at 6:00pm because of the Public Holiday for the Queen's Jubilee - so turn up ready to run!

Different pace and distance groups will be available depending on
numbers of attendees.

The full route is approximately 8 miles.
