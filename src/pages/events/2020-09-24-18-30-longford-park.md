This week's group run will be the Longford Park route starting from 
outside the Y Club at 6:30pm on 24th September.

Different pace and distance groups will be available depending on 
numbers of attendees, and in accordance with current COVID-19 
guidance from England Athletics, we can now remove the limit 
on attendees as long as we have enough group leaders available, 
with each leader able to lead sub-groups of 12.

The full Longford Park route is approximately 8 miles, while the
shorter Stone Bridge route is an out-and-back route of 6 miles.
