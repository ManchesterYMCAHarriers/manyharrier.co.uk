This Saturday is our fourth and final summer trial run! It's been a lovely chance to explore parts of Greater Manchester and get to know other club mates in a relaxed setting. 

Due to the train strikes this Saturday (and awkward bus timetabling) we've had to change the location of the trail run. We will be starting at Moses Gate Country Park (https://goo.gl/maps/wXMfse3QCDgUV2wB7) and finishing at The Horseshoe pub (https://goo.gl/maps/pteEHT9P8JGKbM9r5). 

**NB: This is a point to point run, with the pub being about 2 miles from the start point - this will affect those thinking of using a car to meet up with us.**

For those using the bus from town, we will meet at Shudehill bus station at 9:50 to get the 8 bus from Stand H at 10:02. We should get to the start point at around 10:50. After the run, we will also get the 8 back into town, but from a different location. It will all make sense on the day - promise!

There will be a 10K run led by Sam and a 16K run led by Dan. No set pace - nice and easy. It's a fun route; I like to think of it as an urban trail run. 

Really looking forward to seeing you there - it'll be great fun. Don't let the bus nightmare put you off!
