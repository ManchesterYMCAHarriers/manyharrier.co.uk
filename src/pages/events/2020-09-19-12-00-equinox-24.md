## Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic (coronavirus)

We are looking to enter a couple of teams for the [Equinox 24](https://www.equinox24.co.uk).

The Equinox 24 is a 24-hour relay event that starts at 12:00 noon on the Saturday
closest to the autumnal equinox. Teams of up to 8 people run in a relay around
a mixed-terrain 10-kilometre route in the grounds of Belvoir Castle in 
Leicestershire. Running continues throughout the night until noon the following
day.

Please let us know if your interested in taking part (or not) at this
