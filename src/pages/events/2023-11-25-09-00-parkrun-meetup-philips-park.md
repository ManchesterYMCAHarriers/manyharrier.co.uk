Our "parkrun meetup" this month is at Philips Park, and this time we're volunteering!

If you'd like to help out, all you need to do is email [philipspark@parkrun.com](mailto:philipspark@parkrun.com) 
to let them know you'd like to volunteer on that date. Just give your name, parkrun barcode number and if there's a 
specific role you would prefer, mention that as well.

You can find out about the different roles and check the volunteer roster here:
