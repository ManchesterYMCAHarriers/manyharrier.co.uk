Thinking of joining a running club? Why not come and try out Manchester YMCA Harriers on our New Runner's Night!

We will meet at the Y Club reception at 6:30pm before going for a run around MediaCity. No one will be left behind 
as we'll separate into several groups, each running at a slightly different pace. The full route is just over 6 miles, 
and we'll also have a shorter option.

Running with a group will help keep you motivated, it' safer, and you'll meet lots of friendly faces too. 
There's no obligation to join, so come and give it a try!

After the run we'll head to a nearby pub for chips, drinks and a chat. Hope to see you there!
