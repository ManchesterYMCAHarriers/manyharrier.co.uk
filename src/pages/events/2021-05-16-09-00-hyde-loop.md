We're offering two runs starting at the Queen Victoria statue in Piccadilly Gardens this Sunday:

* a 16-mile route, heading out along the Ashton Canal, turning down the
  Peak Forest Canal and then returning via Hyde Road; and
* an 11-mile route which follows the same course, leaves the canal at Audenshaw and goes through Debdale Park. ([Route map](/routes/not-quite-to-hyde-loop/))

The run will take place in accordance with [current COVID-19
guidance from England Athletics](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance/).
