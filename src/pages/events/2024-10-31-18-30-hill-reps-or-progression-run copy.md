On the last Thursday of every month, we will be holding a 5k to 10k progression runaround Peel Park. If you've just
completed couch to 5k and you want to keep increasing your distance, this is the session for you. Don't worry about
pace, this session is all about increasing your distance with the aim of getting you to 10k. No one is ever left
behind, so feel free to come along and give it a go.

Alongside the 5k to 10k run, there we also be another group doing a 20-minute hill rep session each month.

Our last Thursday of the month runs usually finish a little earlier than other Thursdays and so after the run we have
our "Last Thursday" social where we'll head somewhere nearby for food and drinks. Look out for confirmation of the
venue on our WhatsApp group.
