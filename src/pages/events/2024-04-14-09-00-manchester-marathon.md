It's one of the biggest days in Manchester running calendar and several of our members will be on the start line, 
some of whom will be taking on the marathon distance for the first time.

If you're not running, why not come out to cheer on your fellow Harriers. We usually congregate at certain points on 
the course, so look out for updates on this nearer the time, as well as any plans for post-race celebrations.

Race information is on the [Manchester Marathon](https://www.manchestermarathon.co.uk/home/) website.
