Half-marathon starts at 8:30am; 10K starts at 11:30am.

Some of our members will be running either the 10k or the Half, and there are likely 
to be others watching on the day. We usually congregate at certain points on the course 
to cheer on our fellow Harriers, so look out for updates on this nearer the time.
