The club is hoping to enter some teams in the North West Road Relays. This should be a really good event with lots of 
local clubs involved. The women's race (teams of 3) starts at 1pm and the men's race (teams of 4) is at 2:30pm. Each 
individual relay leg is 5.8km.

If you would like to be part of a team, please [add your name to this Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/iykhap3rxcqy3n5w) 
**before Sunday 5th September**.
