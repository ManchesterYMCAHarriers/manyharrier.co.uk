This week's group run will be the Kersal Wetlands route starting from 
outside the Y Club at 6:30pm on 1st April.

Different pace and distance groups will be available depending on 
numbers of attendees. The run will take place in accordance with [current COVID-19 
guidance from England Athletics](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance/).

Please note that **the Y Club is closed until 12th April** - so turn up
dressed to run as there will be no changing facilities available.

The full Kersal Wetlands route is approximately 8-miles, or you can cut it
short by only doing one lap of the Wetlands, which will be around 7-miles. 

A shorter 5K alternative route will also be available.
