This event takes place every September in a different location around the North West, but this year 
it’s happening right on our doorstep at Heaton Park. Each leg of the relay is a 5km lap of Heaton Park, 
with teams of 4 required for the men’s race and teams of 3 for the women’s race.

To be part of a team you just need to be a first claim member of the club (remember to wear a club 
T-shirt or vest on the day). Phil T is organising the teams for this one, so if you’d like to get 
involved **just let him know before entries close on 3rd September**.
