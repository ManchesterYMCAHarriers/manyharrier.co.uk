The Tour of Tameside is a series of 4 races taking place on consecutive days over various distances and terrain - 
a 10k trail race, a fell race, a half marathon and a 7 mile road race.

Several members of the club will be tackling the event and entries are still open here:

If you donâ€™t fancy the full tour, why not enter one or two of the individual races to see what it's all about.
