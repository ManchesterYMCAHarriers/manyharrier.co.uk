Thinking of joining a running club? Why not come and try out Manchester YMCA Harriers on our New Runners Night! 
This is part of our New Runners Week from 18th to 25th January.

We will meet at the Y Club reception at 6:30pm before going for a run around MediaCity. No one will be left behind 
as we'll separate into several groups, each running at a slightly different pace. The full route is just over 6 
miles (about 10k) and we'll also have a 3 mile option (about 5k).

Running with a group will help keep you motivated, it's safer, and you'll meet lots of friendly faces too. There's no 
obligation to join, so come and give it a try!
