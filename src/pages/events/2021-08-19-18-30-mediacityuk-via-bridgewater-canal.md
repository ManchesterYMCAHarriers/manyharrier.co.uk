This week's group run will be the MediaCityUK via Bridgewater Canal route starting from
outside the Y Club at 6:30pm.

The full route is approximately 5.5 miles. There is an option to do
an extended route to take the distance to 8 miles for those who wish to. There will also be a
shorter route for those who prefer a shorter run.
