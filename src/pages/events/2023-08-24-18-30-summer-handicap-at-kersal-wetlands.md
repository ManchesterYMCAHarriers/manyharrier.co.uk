This week, instead of the normal club run, we're doing a handicap run around Kersal Wetlands. 
We'll meet at the Y Club at 6:30pm as usual and then do a warm up jog to the Wetlands (about 4k).

We'll then run 5k (two laps) around the Wetlands, but we will set everyone off at slightly 
different times, which means, if we get it right you will all finish at around the same time. 
The first person across the line will be the winner of our Summer Handicap.

Should be fun. Hope to see lots of you there!
