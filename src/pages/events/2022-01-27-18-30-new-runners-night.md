Thinking of joining a running club but not sure if you're good enough or fast enough? Want to train during the winter 
but don't want to go out running alone in the dark? Don't worry - come and try out the Manchester YMCA Harriers with 
our New Runners' Night!

We will meet at 6.30pm at the Y Club reception and do a quick warm up before going out for a short run in different 
pace groups. All levels of runners will be catered for so no one will be left behind and you don't need to worry about 
being too fast or too slow.

In the midst of early winter sunsets and cold weather, running with a group is much safer, it will keep you motivated 
and you'll meet lots of friendly faces too! It's also way more fun to run with others than alone.

As an England Athletics affiliated running club based at the Y Club, we train regularly during the week and we are a 
complete mixed group of male/female, older/younger and faster/not so fast runners. What we all have in common is that 
we are very friendly and we love running and seeing new members come along to try it out! There is no obligation to join, 
just come and see what you think!

After the run we will all head for a social night with chips, beers and a chat which you are welcome to come along to too!
If you've got any questions just drop us a line, otherwise come along and give it a go!

See you there!
