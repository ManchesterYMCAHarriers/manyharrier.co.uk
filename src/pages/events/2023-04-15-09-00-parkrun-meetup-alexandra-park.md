Our “parkrun meetup” this month is at Alexandra Park, and this time we're volunteering!

If you'd like to help out, all you need to do is email Alexandra@parkrun.com to let them know you'd like to volunteer on that date. Just give your name, parkrun barcode number and if there's a specific role you would prefer, mention that as well.

On the day, try to arrive around 30 minutes before the start of the run, to give the event team enough time to give you instructions.

As usual, after the run has finished, we'll go somewhere nearby for coffee.
