This is the fifth race in our [2020 Summer Championship](/championships/2020-summer-championship/).

Race information at the [Middleton Harriers website](https://middletonharriers.jimdo.com/our-races-eddies-revenge/) 
and at [fellrunner.org.uk](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/races.php?id=6799).

This is a **Category A** fell race - there's a lot of climbing relative to the
distance covered. However, the course is marshalled so it is accessible if you
are new to fell running.

Entry is available on the day only at the Race HQ, priced at Â£5.00 - or entry is
free if you bring along a homemade cake to give away in the raffle!
