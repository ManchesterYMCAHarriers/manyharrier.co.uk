The Coniston 14 is probably the most picturesque road race in Britain. It's a 14-miler with plenty of hills, and the 
race has been a happy hunting ground for the club in recent years, with prizes for individuals and teams.

Lots of members of the club are planning to enter this one, and many of us will be staying in nearby Ambleside on the 
Saturday night.

Why not join us for what promises to be a great weekend in the Lakes!
