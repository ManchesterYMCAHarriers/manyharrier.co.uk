In lieu of our Summer Championships, this year we will be holding a Harriers' 5K Race on Thursday 26th August! 
This is a race within the club against your fellow Harriers. We will meet at 6.30pm at the Y Club as usual, then 
warm up on a jog over to the Kersal Wetlands together. From there the course will be a timed 5K route around the 
Wetlands.

We will then cool down on a run back to the Y before heading out for our first official "Last Thursday" club outing 
since before the pandemic! This will be the classic fish, chips and beer after the run. If the weather is 
nice we will grab a seat outdoors in the Roman ruins, but if not we will head to Cask.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
