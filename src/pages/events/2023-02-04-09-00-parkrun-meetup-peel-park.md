Our “parkrun meetup” this month is at Peel Park. This time we’re volunteering as well as spreading the word about our 
upcoming New Runner’s Night.

If you’d like to help out, all you need to do is email peel@parkrun.com to let them know you’d like to volunteer on 
that date. Just give your name, parkrun barcode number and if there’s a specific role you would prefer, mention that 
as well.

On the day, try to arrive around 30 minutes before the start of the run, to give the event team enough time to give 
you instructions.

As usual, after the run has finished, we’ll go somewhere nearby for coffee.
