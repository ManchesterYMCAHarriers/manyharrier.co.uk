This week's group run will be the Wharfside route, starting from outside the Y Club at 6:30pm.

We will run as a group out to the Wharfside tram stop (about 1.7 miles). Starting from there everyone runs for 
5 minutes along Trafford Wharf Road, before turning around and running back again.

Everyone will arrive back at the starting point at roughly the same time. We'll regroup for a minute or two, then 
repeat the same thing twice more.

Then after 30 minutes running in total we'll finish with a steady run back to the Y Club.
