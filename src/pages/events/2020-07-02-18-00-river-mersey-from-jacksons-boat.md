Heather will lead a group of up to six people, departing from the car park of the
Jackson's Boat pub at **6:00pm**. The total distance is around 5 miles.

**You must sign up in advance**; numbers will be strictly limited to six people 
and you will not be allowed to run with the group if you have not registered in 
advance.

**Note**: the Jackson's Boat pub is currently closed. There are no 
changing or toilet facilities; you need to turn up "ready to run".
