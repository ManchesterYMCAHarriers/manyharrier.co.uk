The Coniston 14 is probably the most picturesque road race in Britain... it is hilly though!

The race has been a happy hunting ground for the club in recent years, with prizes for individuals and teams.

Lots of members of the club are already entered for this one, and many of us will be staying in nearby Ambleside 
on the Saturday night. Join us for what promises to be a great weekend in the Lakes!
