## Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

**16th March:** Following advice from the UK government to minimise social
 contact due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (coronavirus), Manchester YMCA 
 Harriers track sessions and group runs are cancelled until further notice.
 
The Longford Park Stadium is not available this week and the Manchester Regional
Arena track is still undergoing replacement. Instead of our usual track session,
we will hold an alternative session focusing on running stability.
 
The session will take place on the grass near the caf√© in Longford Park.
