Come and join us this weekend for a Sunday morning long run.

These runs are primarily aimed at the members of the club who are training for a marathon in the Spring, particularly 
those preparing for their first marathon. Of course, you don't have to be marathon training - if you fancy a long run 
on a Sunday morning please come along.

- The length of the run will increase by about a mile each week, starting with 10 miles on 7th January and progressing 
    up to 20 miles by mid-March. So, you will need to already be able to run at least 10 miles.
- There is no set pace for the run as the emphasis will be on increasing your distance rather than running at your 
    fastest pace. Every run will be led by a member of the club.
- Routes will vary from week to week. Check out our WhatsApp group for details of this week's route.

**Note:** Other members of the club are likely to be heading out for Sunday morning long runs from the Y Club, but these 
will be organised informally on the WhatsApp group and are not guaranteed to take place every single week.
