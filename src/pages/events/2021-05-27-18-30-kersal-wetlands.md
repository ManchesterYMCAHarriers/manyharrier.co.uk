This week's group run will be the Kersal Wetlands route starting from 
outside the Y Club at 6:30pm.

Different pace and distance groups will be available depending on 
numbers of attendees. The run will take place in accordance with [current COVID-19 
guidance from England Athletics](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance/).

The full Kersal Wetlands route is approximately 8-miles, or you can cut it
short by only doing one lap of the Wetlands, which will be around 7-miles. 

A shorter 4-5 mile alternative route will also be available.
