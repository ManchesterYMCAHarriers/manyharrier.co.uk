As a local club, we have been invited to join RunThrough Events and volunteer at their Oulton Park Running Grand Prix 
on 8th August! 

Each volunteer will receive either a free place in a future event, or a Â£30 donation to the club as a thank you. 

This is a great opportunity to give back to the running community to ensure these races come back with a bang, 
whilst also having a bit of a day out with your fellow Harriers! It would be great to get an enthusiastic group of us 
out there! 

If you would like to volunteer, please complete [this Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/fzuwthautwusxzdm) by **Sunday 16th May**
and we will pass on your names to the race organisers:

But that's not it! RunThrough are also offering our club two free places of any distance, at the event on 8th August. 
If you would like to be in the - _ahem_ - running for one of these places please [get in touch](/contact) by **Sunday 16th May**
stating which distance you would like to enter. Names will be pulled out of a hat and the lucky winners will be 
notified and names passed on to the race organisers.

This should be a really good event and a great way for the club to return to a bit of running normality!

Hopefully see you there!
