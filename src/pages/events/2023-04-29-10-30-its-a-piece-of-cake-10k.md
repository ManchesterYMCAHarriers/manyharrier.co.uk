This is the first race in our [2023 Summer Championship](/championships/2023-summer-championship/).

The 2023 Summer Championship gets underway at this challenging 10K race organised by Manchester Frontrunners. 
An undulating three lap course on the tarmac paths of North Manchester's Boggart Hole Clough, this race is a highlight 
of the calendar for many Harriers.

Be sure to bring plenty of change for the post-race Cake Sale in support of local charity the George House Trust.
