The evening will start with our Handicap Race at 6.30pm (Sharp!) from the Y Club. 

The race will be a 3 lap course. 

You will need to let the Captains know what time you anticipate finishing the race before you start. The runner with the most accurate predicted time will win! 

**No watches will be allowed**, so leave your watch at home or prepare for the Christmas Grinch to look after it while you run! 

Christmas fancy dress is encouraged!

There will be our Christmas Party afterwards at Castlefield Hotel.
