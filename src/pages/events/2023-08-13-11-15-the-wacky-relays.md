Organised by Prestwich Athletic Club, The Wacky Relays involves teams of four runners; each of whom complete one loop 
of the 1.3 mile/2 km circuit before handing over their baton to the next runner.

The route is on trails around Philips Park which are wide and generally firm, but may be muddy if there has been rain, 
so trail shoes are advised. There will be a charity cake stand plus pie and peas, coffee and a bar at the rugby club.

We will hopefully enter several teams in the event.

Entry is at [https://bookitzone.com/joanne_houghton/KFjFFX](https://bookitzone.com/joanne_houghton/KFjFFX). £5 per team member if affiliated / £7 per team member if unaffiliated.
