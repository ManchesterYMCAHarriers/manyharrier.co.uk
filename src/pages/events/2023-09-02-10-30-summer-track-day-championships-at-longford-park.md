Our annual track day will consist of 4 races: 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m. 
The idea of track day is that it's a fun event, at which we try some distances that are 
a lot shorter than the races we might normally be running in. 
You won't need any prior experience of track running or any specific footwear that's 
different to that which you would usually run in.

You'll need to pay Â£4 cash on the door to use the track.

After the running is finished, we'll go somewhere nearby for food and drinks. Hope to see you there!
