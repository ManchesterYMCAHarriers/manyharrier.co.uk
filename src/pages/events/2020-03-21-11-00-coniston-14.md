The Coniston 14 is probably the most picturesque road race in Britain... it is
hilly though!

The race has been a happy hunting ground for the club in recent years, with
prizes for individuals and teams.

## Stay overnight

After the race, a contingent from the club will be staying overnight at the 
Youth Hostel in Ambleside. We will go out for a meal and then on for drinks until
late!

## Marathon Training

Steph has marked this race as a shorter alternative to the planned [Kingsway session](/events/2020-03-22-10-00-stephs-marathon-training-kingsway/)
in her Marathon training plan that takes place the following day, for those who
are tapering for a marathon in early April.
