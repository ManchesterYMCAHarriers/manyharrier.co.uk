Our "parkrun meetup" this month is at Philips Park, and this time we're volunteering!

If you'd like to help out, all you need to do is email philipspark@parkrun.com to let them know you'd like to volunteer on that date. Just give your name, parkrun barcode number and if there's a specific role you would prefer, mention that as well.

As usual, after the run has finished, we'll go somewhere nearby for coffee.
