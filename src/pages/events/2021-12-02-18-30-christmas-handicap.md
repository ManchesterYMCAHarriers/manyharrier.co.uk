We are delighted to be bringing you our annual Christmas Handicap race again this year!

The race works like this: you give Craig and Sarah your anticipated finish time (roughly 5k) when you sign up, and the 
person closest to their time wins! We have had people within **one second** of their predicted time - can you beat that?!! 

The only rules are that you must provide your time before the race, and **STRICTLY NO WATCHES ALLOWED!**

The 5K route remains the same as the last two years and it is three laps.
