We are thrilled to be able to hold our annual Christmas Handicap 5K race, followed by our [Harriers Christmas Party](/events/2021-12-02-20-00-christmas-party/) again this year!

The evening will start with our Handicap Race at 6.30pm (Sharp!) from the Y Club. 

The race will be a 3 lap course and we will hold a recce the week before for members who have not run this course before. 

To enter the race, please complete [this Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/gh26g9ctet9ur4ep) and let Craig and Sarah know what time you anticipate finishing the race. The runner with the most accurate predicted time will win! 

**No watches will be allowed**, so leave your watch at home or prepare for the Christmas Grinch to look after it while you run! 

Christmas fancy dress is encouraged!

Immediately after the race, we'll head over to Porta Tapas in Salford for our Christmas Party. The cost is Â£25 per person and includes a tapas buffet. Check out the [Christmas Party event page](/events/2021-12-02-20-00-christmas-party/) for more information and to pay for food!
