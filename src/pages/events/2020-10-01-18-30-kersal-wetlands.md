This week's group run will be the Kersal Wetlands route starting from 
outside the Y Club at 6:30pm on 1st October.

Different pace and distance groups will be available depending on 
numbers of attendees, and in accordance with current COVID-19 
guidance from England Athletics, we can now remove the limit 
on attendees as long as we have enough group leaders available, 
with each leader able to lead sub-groups of 12.

The full Kersal Wetlands route is approximately 7.5-miles, or you can cut it
short to by only doing one lap of the Wetlands, which will be 6 miles. 

A shorter 4-mile alternative route will also be available.
