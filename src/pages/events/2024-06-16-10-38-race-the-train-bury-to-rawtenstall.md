This is the third race in our [2024 Summer Championship](/championships/2024-summer-championship/).

Another race returning to our Summer Championship for 2024, this one will start from Bury Bolton Street train station 
on the sound of the steam train's whistle. Runners will then set off north along trail paths that run alongside the 
railway lines and the River Irwell. The run is from point to point, finishing at Rawtenstall Station approximately 11 
miles away.

There is a drop off point on platform 3 for competitors' bags. These will be loaded onto the train and dropped off 
at Rawtenstall Station.
