This long run is approximately 16-miles in distance, taking in four parkrun venues. We first head out to Alexandra Park,
across to Platt Fields Park, then down to Fletcher Moss Park and finally onto Longford Park before heading for home.

Two different pace groups will be available subject to demand - one at 8 minutes per mile, 
another at 9 minutes per mile. The run will take place in accordance with [current COVID-19
guidance from England Athletics](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance/).
