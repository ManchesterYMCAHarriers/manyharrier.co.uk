For the third year running, the club is organising four social trail runs around Greater Manchester. 
In May we are going to New Mills. This is a new destination for this series.

We will meet at Manchester Piccadilly station to catch the 09:48 (subject to timetable changes), head out 
and go for a run! Details will be confirmed in the club WhatsApp group.

We will finish with pints at a nearby pub before heading back to Manchester. We'll aim to be back by mid-afternoon. 

There will be a shorter route (~10km) and a longer route (~16km) available. Both groups will have a leader so you 
don't need to worry about getting lost. No set pace - nice and easy conversational pace to take in the surroundings. 
This is a great opportunity to enjoy a different side to the sport.

All you need to bring is some trail shoes, a train ticket and a sense of adventure!
