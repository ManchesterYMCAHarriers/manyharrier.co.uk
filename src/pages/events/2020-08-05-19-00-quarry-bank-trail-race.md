A challenging 4.5-mile trail race that starts and finishes at Quarry Bank Mill.

An interesting and varied course; running alongside Manchester Airport for a 
stretch, you'll probably be racing an aircraft for a short stretch! The route
then heads into the woodland of Styal Country Park. Plenty of ascent and 
descent - mainly on steps!

Race entry opens on Saturday 22nd February and **will sell out fast**.
