This is the fifth race in our [2022 Summer Championship](/championships/2022-summer-championship/).

Race information at the [Middleton Harriers website](https://middletonharriers.jimdo.com/our-races-2022/eddie-s-revenge/) 
and at [fellrunner.org.uk](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/races/0d7ad288-671b-4f72-b59d-15c3a33863b8).

This is a **Category A** fell race - there's a lot of climbing relative to the
distance covered. However, the course is marshalled so it is accessible if you
are new to fell running.

Entry is **in advance**: [£6.00 for Fell Runners Association members / £7.00 for FRA non-members](https://www.sientries.co.uk/event.php?event_id=9042). 
Collect your number on the day from Race HQ.
