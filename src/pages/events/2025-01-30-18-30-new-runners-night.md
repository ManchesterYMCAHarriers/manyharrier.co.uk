Thinking of joining a running club? Why not come and try out Manchester YMCA Harriers on our New Runners Night! 

We will meet at the Y Club reception at 6:30pm before going for a run around Salford Quays. Don't worry about to much about pace, this session is all about having a good run with the aim of introducing you to our club and meeting new people. No one is ever left behind, so feel free to come along and give it a go.

Running with a group will help keep you motivated, it's safer, and you'll meet lots of friendly faces too. There's no obligation to join, so come and give it a try!

Should you want a shorter run, we will have a 5k option, and all our pace groups will be running.

As a bonus, our run on the last Thursday of every month usually finishes a little earlier than other Thursdays. This is because we have our "Last Thursday" social where we'll head somewhere nearby for food and drinks. Look out for confirmation of the venue on our WhatsApp group.
