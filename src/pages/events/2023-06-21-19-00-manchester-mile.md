The Manchester Mile is a track event in which runners are separated into heats based 
on their predicted time, to ensure you're running with people of a similar speed. 
Last year's event saw finishing times ranging from 9 minutes to 4 minutes 30 seconds.

The exact start time for your race will depend on which heat you are allocated to. 
Faster runner will be placed in the later heats. One of the unique aspects of this 
event is that it provides a great opportunity to cheer on your fellow Harriers 
running in earlier or later heats.
