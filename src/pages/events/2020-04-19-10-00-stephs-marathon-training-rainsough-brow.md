Steph's marathon training plan is a "get you round" schedule aimed at first-time
Marathon runners. 

You should be able to run 10 miles comfortably before you start. 

The weekend long run should be supplemented with faster mid-week running. 
You should aim to do a minimum of three 20-milers and a maximum of five.
