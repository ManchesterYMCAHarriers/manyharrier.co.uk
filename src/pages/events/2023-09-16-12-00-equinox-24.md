We are returning to Belvoir Castle this year for this popular event in which teams 
run as many laps as they can around a 10k route over the course of 24 hours. 
Further details can be found here: [https://www.equinox24.co.uk/](https://www.equinox24.co.uk/)

The club will be entering teams of 5 people and we already have 3 teams confirmed. 
Speak to Dan if you're interested in getting involved.
