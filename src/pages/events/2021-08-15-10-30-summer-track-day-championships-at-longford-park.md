We are delighted to be able to hold our annual Track Day Championships again this Summer on Sunday 15th August. This is 
a chance to race among your fellow Harriers over a variety of track distances, whilst having some fun together. If 
you've not been to track or fear this is for 'serious' runners only – don't be fooled! The emphasis is definitely on 
having some fun and a long overdue get together, whilst also running and being in with the chance of a trophy!
