## Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic (coronavirus)

The Welsh Castles Relay is a 20-stage, 200+ mile relay race between Caernarfon 
and Cardiff. The route passes within 2 miles of 23 Castles, 14 Forts (Roman or 
otherwise), 2 Mottes & Bailey and 5 Mottes. The event is a madcap logistical 
nightmare, ensuring runners for each stage are in the right place at the right 
time and... it's probably the most fun you can have running!

The stages range from between 8.5 to 13.1 miles in distance, with some 
"mountain" stages. Each stage has a cut-off time; runners are expected to 
sustain a minimum pace of 9-minutes per mile regardless of the terrain or 
distance.

The club was successful in being awarded a place this year - we hope to get
a place in next year's event instead.
