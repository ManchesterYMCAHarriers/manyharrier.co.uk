The club has applied for a place in the 2020 Welsh Castles Relay - we will find
out in March if our application has been successful.

The Welsh Castles Relay is an epic 20-stage event that takes place over two
days. Starting in Caernarfon in North Wales on the Saturday, the race makes its 
way down to Newtown in mid-Wales, breaking overnight, before continuing on to
Cardiff on the Sunday.

The event is great fun, but it is a logistical challenge! We need at least 20 
runners in order to be able to compete in the event. So, please book the time
in your diary and let us know if you're available to run (or not) at this 
[Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/ckpdffuus7ux6tf8).
