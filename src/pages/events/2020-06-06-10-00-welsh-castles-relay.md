The Welsh Castles Relay is a 20-stage, 200+ mile relay race between Caernarfon 
and Cardiff. The route passes within 2 miles of 23 Castles, 14 Forts (Roman or 
otherwise), 2 Mottes & Bailey and 5 Mottes. The event is a madcap logistical 
nightmare, ensuring runners for each stage are in the right place at the right 
time and... it's probably the most fun you can have running!

After a few years' absence, the Manchester YMCA Harriers are looking to enter a 
team for the 2020 edition of the Welsh Castles Relay. This means we need at 
least 20 runners who are available on the weekend of 6th-7th June, plus 
volunteers to drive/support as necessary.

The stages range from between 8.5 to 13.1 miles in distance, with some 
"mountain" stages. Each stage has a cut-off time; runners are expected to 
sustain a minimum pace of 9-minutes per mile regardless of the terrain or 
distance.

The club has applied for a place and we will find out in March whether we have
 been successful. However, if you want to take part, please book the date in 
 your diary now and let us know if you're available to run (or not) at this 
[Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/ckpdffuus7ux6tf8).
