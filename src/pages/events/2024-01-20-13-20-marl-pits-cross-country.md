**Important note:** Change of venue

The third of this season's South East Lancs Cross Country League and
the sixth fixture of our club's cross country championship.

Please note, as this race is being combined with a fixture in another cross country league, new numbers will need to be 
issued for this particular race. A member of the club will pick up the numbers on the day and distribute them to our 
runners.
