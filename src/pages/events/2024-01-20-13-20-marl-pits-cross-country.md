**Important note:** Change of venue and start time

The third of this season's South East Lancs Cross Country League and
the sixth fixture of our club's cross country championship.

Please note, as this race is being combined with a fixture in another cross country league, new numbers will need to be 
issued for this particular race. A member of the club will pick up the numbers on the day and distribute them to our 
runners.

The start times are also slightly later than normal for the South East Lancs league: 
the women's race starts at **1:35pm**, and the men's race starts at **2:15pm.**
