This week's group run will be the Kings Road route,
starting from outside the Y Club at 6:30pm on 15th October.

Different pace and distance groups will be available depending on 
numbers of attendees, and in accordance with current COVID-19 
guidance from England Athletics, we can now remove the limit 
on attendees as long as we have enough group leaders available, 
with each leader able to lead sub-groups of 12.

**If you do fancy being a group leader, please don't be shy!** However, please do ensure that
you are super familiar with our [coronavirus group running guidance](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance).

The full route is approximately 7-miles. A shorter alternative 3-mile route will also be available.

**Please sign up in advance - with your full name** - using the
