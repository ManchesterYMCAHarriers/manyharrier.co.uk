This is an additional race in our [2024 Summer Championship](/championships/2024-summer-championship/), because the
Wigan Trail 10K sold out extremely quickly.

A 6 mile trail race organised by East Cheshire Harriers. The race follows the tracks and paths of Daisy Nook, 
and includes some hilly sections.

Entries are open now at at [BookItZone.com](https://bookitzone.com/martin_mcgann_1/xyjFFX).
