Instead of the normal club run, we're going to do a handicap race around Kersal Wetlands. We'll meet at the Y Club at 6:30 as usual, then do a warm up jog to the Wetlands (about 4k). 

We'll then run 5k (two laps) around the Wetlands, but we'll start you all off at different times, so hopefully, if we get it right, everyone will finish at around the same time. The first person over the line will be the winner of our Summer Handicap.

Should be fun. Hopefully see lots of you there!
