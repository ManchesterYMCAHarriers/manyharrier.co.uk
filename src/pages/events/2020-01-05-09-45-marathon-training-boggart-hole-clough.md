This marathon training route is approximately 14 miles in distance, with paces
ranging from 6:45 min/mile up to 9:00 min/mile.

From the Y Club, we're first going to head over to the Sugden Centre just off 
Oxford Road to meet up with the Manchester Frontrunners' marathon training 
group; we'll leave the Sugden Centre at 10:00am.
