This is the seventh race in our [2024 Summer Championship](/championships/2024-summer-championship/).

A new addition to our Summer Championship, this 2-lap event takes place on closed roads around Ellesmere Park in 
Monton and includes fast sections on the Swinton Greenway around Eccles College.

If you haven't done a 5-mile race before, why not enter this one and start your bank holiday with a guaranteed PB.
