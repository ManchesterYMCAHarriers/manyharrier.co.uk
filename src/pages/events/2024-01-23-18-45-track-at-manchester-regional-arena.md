As part of our New Runners Week, we will be hosting a Track Taster Session. Whether you're a beginner or you've been 
running for years, come and give it a try!

Track running can be really good for beginners because there's never any risk of getting too far from where you started.
You're doing laps of a 400-metre track so you can easily stop whenever you need to.

You'll need to pay at reception to use the track. We would suggest creating an account on the 
[Better UK app](https://www.better.org.uk/booking) to speed things up when you arrive. Lockers, showers and changing 
rooms are available, and you'll need a Â£1 coin to use the lockers.

We meet outside on the track (near to the finish line) at 6:45pm. We'll start with a few dynamic stretches before going
into the main session. If possible, we would suggest arriving a few minutes early so you have time for a couple of warm
up laps.

Hope to see lots of new faces at the session!
