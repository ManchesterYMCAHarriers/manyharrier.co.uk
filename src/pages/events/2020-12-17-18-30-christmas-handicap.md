We are delighted to be bringing you our annual Christmas Handicap race again this year!

The race works like this: you give Craig and Sarah your anticipated finish time (roughly 5k) when you sign up, and the 
person closest to their time wins! We have had people within **one second** of their predicted time - can you beat that?!! 

The only rules are that you must provide your time before the race, and **STRICTLY NO WATCHES ALLOWED!**

The 5K route remains the same as last year and is three laps. We will do a recce lap at 6:30 before the race starts, 
so that everyone is familiar with it! 

**Schedule**

* 6:30 - recce lap
* 6:45ish - race starts  

Due to COVID-19 measures, we will not be providing the results at the end of the race, but they will be announced 
shortly afterwards on the website, social media, WhatsApp and in our email newsletter! Ho Ho Ho!

[Sign up for the Christmas handicap here](https://doodle.com/poll/tfzd5rhssegqtsib) - don't forget to let
Craig and Sarah know your predicted time!
