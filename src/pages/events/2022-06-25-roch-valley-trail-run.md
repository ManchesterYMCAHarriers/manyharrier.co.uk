Join us for a series of trail runs around Greater Manchester over the summer!

For this trail run, we will meet at Manchester Victoria, head out to Littleborough and go for a run!

We will finish with pints at a nearby pub before heading back to Manchester. We'll aim to be back by mid-afternoon.

There'll be two routes available: a shorter route of around 10km and a longer route of around 16km. No specialist trail shoes will be required for the shorter routes.

This is a great opportunity to discover a new side to the sport!
