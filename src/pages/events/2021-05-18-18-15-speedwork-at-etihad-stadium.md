Craig and Sarah organising a speedwork session for up to 24 people outside the Etihad Stadium. 

Unfortunately both Longford Park and the Manchester Regional Arena tracks are unavailable to us this week,
so we are having to improvise an interval session around the Etihad Stadium.

We will start with a warm up at 6:15pm and some dynamic stretches, before going in to the main session.
