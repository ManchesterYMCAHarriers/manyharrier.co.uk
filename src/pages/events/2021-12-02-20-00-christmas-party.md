Our Christmas party will be held this year at Porta Tapas in Salford immediately following [our Christmas Handicap race](/events/2021-12-02-18-30-christmas-handicap/). 

The cost is £25 per person and includes a tapas buffet. 

We have our own bar area and will also be giving out awards for the Christmas Handicap race, the (long overdue!) 2019/20 Cross Country Championship medals and trophies, and the 2021 Track Day awards – so don’t miss it! 

To secure your place at the party, please sign up using the form below before **Friday 26th November**. (**NOTE**: Our bank details for payment will be displayed after you complete the checkout process.)

We can’t wait to see you all and celebrate a fantastic year of running with you all!
