This is the eighth race in our [2023 Summer Championship](/championships/2023-summer-championship/).

The longest race on our Summer Championship this year is this challenging 24km fell race over open moor and footpaths. 
It includes 820m of ascent and although the route is partially flagged, some navigational skills will be helpful.

**PLEASE SEE THE RACE WEBSITE FOR DETAILS ON REQUIRED KIT.**
