Back by popular demand! Following a successful series last year, we are organising four social trail runs around Greater 
Manchester over the summer. In May we will be going to Edale.

We will meet at Manchester Piccadilly station to catch the 09:48 train to Edale, which will arrive at 10:31. We'll then
head out and go for a run! Details will be confirmed in the club WhatsApp group.

We will finish with pints at a nearby pub before heading back to Manchester. We'll aim to be back by mid-afternoon.

There will be a shorter route (~10km) and a longer route (~16km) available. 
Both groups will have a leader so you don't need to worry about getting lost. 
No set pace - nice and easy conversational pace to take in the surroundings. 
This is a great opportunity to enjoy a different side to the sport.

All you need to bring is some trail shoes, a train ticket and a sense of adventure!!!
