This is the second race in our [2023 Summer Championship](/championships/2023-summer-championship/).

Starting and finishing at Staveley Recreation Ground, the 18k Kentmere Trail Race follows fully marked and marshalled footpaths and bridleways, taking in panoramic views of the southern Lakeland fells. Underfoot conditions are quite variable including short sections of tarmac, grassy footpaths, stony bridleways and some stiles to climb over near the end.

Expect a carnival atmosphere with live music, race commentary, food and drink all available at the start and finish.

Please note: there are various race distances available but you’ll need to run the 18k for your result to be included in our club champs.

Entries are £36 and close on Sunday 16th April. Enter at the [Lakeland Trails website](https://www.lakelandtrails.org/staveley).
