## Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

**16th March:** Following advice from the UK government to minimise social
 contact due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (coronavirus), Manchester YMCA 
 Harriers track sessions and group runs are cancelled until further notice.
The Longford Park Stadium is not available this week and the Manchester Regional
Arena track is still undergoing replacement. Instead of our usual track session,
we will hold a relay session at The Meadow, across the river from Peel Park 
in Salford.

We will meet at the Y Club and jog over to The Meadow before starting the main 
session.
