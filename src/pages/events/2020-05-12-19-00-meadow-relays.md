The Longford Park Stadium is not available this week and the Manchester Regional
Arena track is still undergoing replacement. Instead of our usual track session,
we will hold a relay session at The Meadow, across the river from Peel Park 
in Salford.

We will meet at the Y Club and jog over to The Meadow before starting the main 
session.
