Our Christmas Handicap is a two-lap figure-of-eight, which comes in at just
under 5km in distance.

There is a prize in both the senior and veterans categories.

You need to predict your finishing time before the race; the person who completes
the route in the closest time to their predicted time will be adjudged the winner.

There is a catch... you will not be allowed to run with a watch!
