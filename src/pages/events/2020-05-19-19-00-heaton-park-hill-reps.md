The Longford Park Stadium is not available this week and the Manchester Regional
Arena track is still undergoing replacement. Instead of our usual track session,
we will hold a hill repeat session at Heaton Park.

We will meet at the park where the cross country start/finish area is. (Given
that it is May, the weather should be warmer than it is for cross country!) If
the ground is dry, we may do the hill repeats on the grass, otherwise we will
do the repeats on the road known as "Angina Hill" amongst the Heaton parkrun
regulars!
