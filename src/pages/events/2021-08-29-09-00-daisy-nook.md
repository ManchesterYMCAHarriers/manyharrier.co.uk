We're offering two runs starting at the Queen Victoria statue in Piccadilly Gardens this Sunday:

* a 16-mile run starting out along the Ashton Canal as far as the Etihad Campus, then heading through 
  Phillips Park and Clayton Vale before finding its way onto the course of the old
  Hollinwood Branch Canal, which then takes us on to Daisy Nook Country Park. We do an extended route around Daisy Nook
  before heading across to the Rochdale Canal for the return home.
* a 13-mile route which follows the same course, but takes a direct route through Daisy Nook. ([Route map](/routes/little-daisy-nook/))
