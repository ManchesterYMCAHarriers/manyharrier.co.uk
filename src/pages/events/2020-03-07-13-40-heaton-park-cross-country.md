The fourth of this season's South East Lancs Cross Country League fixtures and
the final fixture of our club's cross country championship.

**Important note:** This fixture replaces [the cancelled Yarrow Valley fixture](/events/2020-02-15-13-40-yarrow-valley-cross-country/)
from the 15th February.

The host club (East Cheshire Harriers and Tameside AC) have asked for help from
other clubs with marshalling duties. We expect that your help will be needed from 
approximately 11:30am until 4:00pm (the first race starts at 12:30pm). 
If you want to volunteer to help out, please sign up using this [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/qxny23vmtma2hsi5).
Thanks!
