This is the fourth race in our [2024 Summer Championship](/championships/2024-summer-championship/).

A regular fixture on our club championship in recent years, the Sale Sizzlers are a very popular series of 
5k road races taking place between June and August, which are organised by Sale Harriers. These races 
provide a great opportunity for a 5k PB.

This year weâ€™ve chosen the 2nd of the 4 races, which is on Friday 5th July.
