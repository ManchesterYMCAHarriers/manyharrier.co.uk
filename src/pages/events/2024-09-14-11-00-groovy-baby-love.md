This is the eighth race in our [2024 Summer Championship](/championships/2024-summer-championship/).

At 18k this is the longest fell race on this year's championship, but is a slightly shorter version of the 
"Groovy Kinder Love" race which takes place at the same time. You just need to enter Groovy Kinder Love and then choose 
the "baby" version at race number allocation.

Please see the [Pennine Ridge Fell Runner website](https://pennineridgefellrunner.blogspot.com/2019/12/kinder-groovy-love_3.html) 
for details on required kit.
