We're offering two runs starting at the Y Club this Sunday: 

* a 16-mile route heading out via Salford and Buile Hill Park to Monton, then doing the Worsley Woods parkrun route, 
  then heading back to the Y Club via the Bridgewater Canal; or
* a 12-mile route which follows the same course, but omits the Worsley Woods parkrun section. ([Route map](/routes/worsley-little-wiggle/))

The run will take place in accordance with [current COVID-19
guidance from England Athletics](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance/).
