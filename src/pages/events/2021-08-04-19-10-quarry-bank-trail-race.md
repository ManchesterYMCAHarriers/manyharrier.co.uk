A challenging 4.5-mile trail race that starts and finishes at Quarry Bank Mill.

An interesting and varied course; running alongside Manchester Airport for a 
stretch, you'll probably be racing an aircraft for a short stretch! The route
then heads into the woodland of Styal Country Park. Plenty of ascent and 
descent - mainly on steps!

Race entry is sold out, however some Harriers have places to transfer - ask on the WhatsApp group if you don't have a
place and want one.
