In accordance with guidance from England Athletics, with the end of
the national lockdown restrictions on 2nd December, we can restart
our group runs!

We'll kick things off again with the Kings Road route.

Different pace and distance groups will be available depending on 
numbers of attendees, and in accordance with current COVID-19 
guidance from England Athletics, we can now remove the limit 
on attendees as long as we have enough group leaders available, 
with each leader able to lead sub-groups of 12.

**If you do fancy being a group leader, please don't be shy!** However, please do ensure that
you are super familiar with our [coronavirus group running guidance](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance).

The full route is approximately 7-miles. A shorter alternative 3-mile route will also be available.

**Please sign up in advance - with your full name** - using the
