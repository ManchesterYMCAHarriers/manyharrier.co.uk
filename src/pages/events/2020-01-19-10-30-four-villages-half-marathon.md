A challenging half-marathon that starts in Helsby and goes through the villages
of Dunham-on-the-Hill, Manley and Mouldsworth.

To enter the race, visit [the Four Villages Half Marathon entry page on NiftyEntries.com](https://helsbyrunningclub.niftyentries.com/Four-Villages-Half-Marathon-2020/).
More information about the race is available on the [Helsby Running Club website](https://www.helsbyrunningclub.org.uk/four-villages/).

The race does get over-subscribed and entries close on the stroke of midnight on 
New Year's Day.

Steph has marked this race as an alternative to the planned [Lumns Lane session](/events/2020-01-19-10-00-stephs-marathon-training-lumns-lane/)
in her Marathon training plan.
