Our Christmas party will be held this year at Porta Tapas in Salford immediately following [our Christmas Handicap race](/events/2022-12-01-18-30-christmas-handicap/). 

The cost is **£20 for all members (affiliated, second claim or unaffiliated)** and **£30 for non-members**, and this includes a tapas buffet.

On the night, we will be giving out various awards, including the medals and trophies for this year's Summer Championship and Track Championship.

To secure your place at the party, please sign up using the form below (our bank details for payment will be displayed after you complete the checkout process). 

Looking forward to seeing you all there!

**Note for non-member attendees:** Our website doesn't currently let us set two different prices for social events, so the price below is the members' price of £20. If you're bringing a non-member, please add an extra £10 for their ticket when you make your bank transfer. Thanks!
