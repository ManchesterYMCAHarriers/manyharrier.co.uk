## RACE SOLD OUT - More info below

This race sold out very quickly, so we have added the 
[Black Knight Charge](/events/2024-07-24-19-30-black-knight-charge/) to our 
[2024 Summer Championship](/championships/2024-summer-championship/) as an alternative fixture to this one.

### Original info

Organised by Wigan Harriers, this is a new addition to our Summer Championship for 2024. 
The race takes place through the trails of Wigan's Amberswood Park, situated between Spring View and Hindley. 
The route follows a mixture of terrain from woodland trails to wide open gravel paths.
