This is the first race in our [2024 Summer Championship](/championships/2024-summer-championship/).

Organised by Wigan Harriers, this is a new addition to our Summer Championship for 2024. 
The race takes place through the trails of Wigan's Amberswood Park, situated between Spring View and Hindley. 
The route follows a mixture of terrain from woodland trails to wide open gravel paths.
