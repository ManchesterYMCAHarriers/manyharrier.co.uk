We're offering two runs starting at the Y Club this Sunday:

* a 16-mile route taking in four parkrun venues. We first head out to Alexandra Park, across to Platt Fields Park, 
  then down to Fletcher Moss Park and finally onto Longford Park before heading for home; or
* a 12-mile route which follows the same course, but cuts out Fletcher Moss Park by turning onto Mauldeth Road West and
  rejoining the course of the longer route in Chorlton.

The run will take place in accordance with [current COVID-19
guidance from England Athletics](/about/coronavirus-group-running-guidance/).
