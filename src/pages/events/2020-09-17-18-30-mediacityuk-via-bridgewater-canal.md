This week's group run will be the MediaCityUK route starting from 
outside the Y Club at 6:30pm on 17th September.

We will start to introduce different pace groups again depending on 
numbers of attendees so that all paces are accounted for, and in 
accordance with current COVID-19 guidance from England Athletics, 
we can now remove the limit on attendees as long as we have 
enough group leaders available, with each leader able to 
lead sub-groups of 12.
