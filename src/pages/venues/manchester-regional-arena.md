## Cost

You will need to pay to enter the track; it costs £2.40 for people who live in 
the Manchester City Council area and £2.60 for people who live elsewhere - this 
is heavily discounted from the normal cost. After that, there is no further 
charge for our session.

If you are using the track facility for the first time, you will need to fill in
a registration form at the venue reception and get yourself a 
[MCR Active](https://mcractive.com) card, which you then need to bring to each 
future session to get discounted entry.

## Car parking

There is free car parking available next to or near the Manchester Regional 
Arena. The nearest car park can be accessed from Gate 13 on Rowsley Street, 
however it is often full. There is a larger alternative car park accessed from 
Gate 11 on Rowsley Street (Yellow A & B). **Only park in designated spaces - 
do not park on grass verges, etc.**

Postcode for sat-navs: **M11 3FF**
