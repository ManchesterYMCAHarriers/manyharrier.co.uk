## Car Parking

### Athletics facility car park

The car park by the athletics facility is closest to the race start area, but
will likely be full.

Additional parking *may* be available in the field next to the track, however
**this will not be used in very wet weather**.

Postcode for sat-navs: **M23 0PH**

### Stables car park

There is another car park near to the Courtyard Caf√© - a few hundred metres from
the start area.

Postcode for sat-navs: **M23 0AB**

## Public transport

### Tram

The nearest tram stop is the appropriately-named Wythenshawe Park tram stop,
which is in Metrolink zone 3 on the Manchester Airport line.

The tram stop is a 10-minute walk from the start area. From the tram stop, head
left down Wythenshawe Road (past the Gardeners Arms pub). The park is on the
opposite side of the road once you get to the tree-lined section of road. You
can go through the first gate you come to and follow the path through the woods
to the start area.

### Bus

The 101 bus goes from Manchester city-centre, down Princess Parkway. Get off the
bus at Palatine Road/Britannia Hotel and then follow the road under Princess 
Parkway. Bear left onto Wythenshawe Road and the park is on your left.
The start area is at the far-end of the park from here - about a 15-minute walk.

The 101, 102, 103 and 108 will take you back to Manchester; these go from the
stop on the Manchester-bound slip-road onto Princess Parkway.
