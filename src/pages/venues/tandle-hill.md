# Car parking

There is a car park in Tandle Hill Country Park, however note that the race is on farmland next to the park, not in the park itself. There is plenty of on-street car parking in the area, though as always, please park with consideration for local residents.

# Public transport

It is a tram and bus combination to get to this one. First, catch a tram to [Oldham King Street](https://tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/oldham-king-street-tram), which is in Metrolink Zone 3 on the Rochdale via Oldham line. After that, take the [409](https://tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/stops/1800ED15291/409) bus from Stop KA on King Street - there is a stop at the top end of Tandle Hill Road.
