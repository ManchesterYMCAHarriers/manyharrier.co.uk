# Car parking

## On-street

As the race is on farmland next to Tandle Hill Country Park rather than in the park itself,
the best place to park is on Tandle Hill Road or on the streets off it.

As always, please park with consideration for local residents.

Postcode for sat-navs: **OL2 5UX**

# Public transport

It is a tram and bus combination to get to this one!

First, catch a tram to Oldham King Street, which is in Metrolink Zone 3 on the Rochdale via Oldham line. 

After that, take the bus from Stop KA on King Street to the stop at the top end of Tandle Hill Road.

Then, it's a 5-10 minute walk to the start area.
