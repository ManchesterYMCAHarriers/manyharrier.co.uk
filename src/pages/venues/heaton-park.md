## Public Transport

### Tram

Heaton Park tram stop is on the west side of the park, about a 10-minute walk
from the start area. It is in Metrolink zone 3 on the Bury line.

From the tram stop, cross the main road and enter the park. Head straight down
the path to the end, then turn left at the junction. The start area is at the
top of the hill near Heaton Hall and the Stables Café.

above.
