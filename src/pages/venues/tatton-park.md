## Car Parking

### Tatton Park car park

The car park is near Tatton Hall - enter the park via the Rostherne entrance.
There is a rather hefty charge of **Â£7.00** for vehicle parking. 
 
(The league has informed us that there will be a discount if you tell the 
attendant that you are attending the cross country event, but we haven't been
told how much that discount is!)

Postcode for sat-navs: **WA16 6QN**

## Public transport

from the railway station to the start area, so be sure to allow time for this.
