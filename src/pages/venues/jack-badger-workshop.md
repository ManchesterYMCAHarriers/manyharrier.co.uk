## Car Parking

As this is the first time we have raced here we are unaware of the parking. Though Glossop in general does allow road parking.

Postcode for sat-navs: **SK13 7SS**

## Public transport

The nearest train station is Glossop, which has a direct
hourly service from Manchester Piccadilly. Note that it is a 20minute walk 
from the railway station to the start area, so be sure to allow time for this.
