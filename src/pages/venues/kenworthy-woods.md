# Car parking

There is a large car park at the venue. To access the car park, you need to go up Yewtree Lane and then Willenhall Road - **do not use the bus lane off Princess Parkway**.

Also, **do not park on the narrow access roads to the venue.** This has caused chaos in previous years.

An alternative place to park is on the streets on the other side of the M60 motorway, e.g. Fellpark Road (**M23 0EU**); it is then a short walk over a footbridge to the race start. As always, please park with consideration for residents if doing this.

# Public transport

## Tram

The nearest tram stop is [Northern Moor](https://tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/northern-moor-tram), which is in Metrolink Zone 3 on the Manchester Airport line.

It is a 10-minute walk from the tram stop to the venue. From the tram stop, head onto the main road (Sale Road) and turn right, then go down Fellpark Road (fourth road on the left). At the end of Fellpark Road, there is a footbridge across the motorway to the venue.

## Bus

The 41 bus goes from Manchester to near the venue.
