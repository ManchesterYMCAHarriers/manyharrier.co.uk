# Car parking

## Venue car park

There is a large car park at the venue. To access the car park, you need to go up Yewtree Lane and then Willenhall Road - **do not use the bus lane off Princess Parkway**.

Also, **do not park on the narrow access roads to the venue.** This has caused chaos in previous years!

Postcode for sat-navs: **M23 0BD**

## On-street parking

An alternative place to park is on the streets on the other side of the M60 motorway, e.g. Fellpark Road. It is then a short walk over a footbridge to the race start. As always, please park with consideration for residents if doing this.

Postcode for sat-navs: **M23 0EU**
