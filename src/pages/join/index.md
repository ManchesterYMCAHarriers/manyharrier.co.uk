howToJoinUs: |
  If you are interested in joining us, we encourage you to come
  down to one of our Thursday evening club runs and "try before
  you buy".
  
  If you're coming down for the first time and you need
  somewhere to get changed, give the Y Club membership team a
  call on [0161 837 3535](tel:+441618373535) and they
  will make arrangements for you to use the changing facilities
  free of charge. Otherwise, there's no need to let anyone know
  that you're coming - just turn up at the Y Club reception in
  your running kit at 6:30pm.

  Once you decide we are the club for you, join the club using
  our online membership form.

    We love to see our members representing the Club in races,
    both close to home and far away. We give every new member
    their first Manchester YMCA Harriers club vest or T-shirt for
    free!

    Running can be a very individual pursuit, but it doesn't have
    to be - there are many brilliant team running events which we
    take part in.

    Many of our members use running as a way of seeing the wider
    world. Groups of us will regularly travel to places near and
    far to take part in running events.
  
    Our members do everything from an overnighter in the Lake
    District to a long weekend for a big city marathon.

    We are based at the Y Club on Liverpool
    Road in Castlefield - right in the heart of Manchester city
    centre. We're a five-minute walk away from
    Deansgate-Castlefield tram stop.

    We hold club socials on the first Thursday of every month,
    when we exploit the many eating and drinking opportunities
    that Manchester has to offer.
                 
    A hill-repeat session is just that little bit easier when you
    know there's some delicious food and a cold glass of beer
    waiting for you when you get back!
