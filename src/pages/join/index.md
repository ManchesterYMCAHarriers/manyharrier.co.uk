howToJoinUs: |
  If you are interested in joining us, we encourage you to come
  down to one of our Thursday evening club runs and "try before
  you buy".
  
  If you're coming down for the first time and you need
  somewhere to get changed, give the Y Club membership team a
  call on [0161 837 3535](tel:+441618373535) and they
  will make arrangements for you to use the changing facilities
  free of charge. Otherwise, there's no need to let anyone know
  that you're coming - just turn up at the Y Club reception in
  your running kit at 6:30pm.

  Once you decide we are the club for you, join the club using
  our online membership application form:

  Joining a running club - _any running club_ - is a
  great way of getting fit and making friends. The Manchester
  YMCA Harriers are no exception.
  
  ### England Athletics Registration
  All membership packages include registration with England
  Athletics. Some of the key benefits of being an England
  Athletics registered athlete are:
  
  * A £2 discount on entry to most races</li>
  * Discounts at various sports shops and England Athletics partners
  
  For full details of the benefits of being a registered
  athlete, please visit [England Athletics](https://www.englandathletics.org)

  ### Manchester Athletics Scheme
  Manchester YMCA Harriers members have the opportunity to join
  the Manchester Athletics Scheme, which provides discounted
  entry to our track training sessions held at the 
  [Manchester Regional Arena](/venues/manchester-regional-arena).

  ### Complimentary club clobber
  We love to see our members representing the Club in races,
  both close to home and far away. We give every new member
  their first Manchester YMCA Harriers club vest or T-shirt for
  free!

  ### Race as part of a team
  Running can be a very individual pursuit, but it doesn't have
  to be - there are many brilliant team running events which we
  take part in.

  ### Regular jaunts, both at home and abroad
  Many of our members use running as a way of seeing the wider
  world. Groups of us will regularly travel to places near and
  far to take part in running events.

  Our members do everything from an overnighter in the Lake
  District to a long weekend for a big city marathon.

  ### Location, location, location!
  We are based at
  [the Y Club](/venues/the-y-club) on Liverpool
  Road in Castlefield - right in the heart of Manchester city
  centre. We're a five-minute walk away from
  Deansgate-Castlefield tram stop.

  ### It's not all about the running
  We hold club socials on the first Thursday of every month,
  when we exploit the many eating and drinking opportunities
  that Manchester has to offer.
               
  A hill-repeat session is just that little bit easier when you
  know there's some delicious food and a cold glass of beer
  waiting for you when you get back!
