We'll start processing your membership right away!

## What happens now?

As you have joined with second claim membership, you will already be
registered with England Athletics by your first claim club.

If you are looking to represent the Manchester YMCA Harriers in any races, 
please pick up a club vest or T-shirt at any Thursday evening group run.
Remember - your first vest or T-shirt is free of charge!
