We'll start processing your membership right away!

## What happens now?

Our Club Secretary will register you as an athlete with England
Athletics and in the next few weeks they will send you a welcome
pack which contains - amongst other things - your England Athletics
membership card. Your membership card will have your England
Athletics registration number on it, which you may need to provide
when entering races to receive a discount.

Remember - you will only be able to represent the Manchester YMCA
Harriers in disciplines in which your first claim club does not
compete. If that applies to you, please pick up a club vest or
T-shirt at any Thursday evening group run. Remember - your first
vest or T-shirt is free of charge!
