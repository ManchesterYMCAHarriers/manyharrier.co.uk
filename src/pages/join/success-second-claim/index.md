We'll start processing your membership right away!

## What happens now?

As you have joined with second claim membership, you will already be
registered with England Athletics by your first claim club.

Remember - you will only be able to represent the Manchester YMCA
Harriers in disciplines in which your first claim club does not
compete. If that applies to you, please purchase a club vest or
T-shirt at any Thursday evening group run.
