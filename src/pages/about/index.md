description: The history, affiliations, purpose, management and rules of the Manchester YMCA Harriers
---
The Manchester YMCA Harriers were established in 1882. We are one of the oldest running clubs in the UK, if not the world!

We are based at the Y Club in Manchester city centre.

Our club has been associated with YMCA Manchester throughout its history. YMCA Manchester proudly provide training and education and health and wellbeing programmes to young people and communities across Manchester and Salford.

## Races and events

We have various club championships, which cover cross-country, fell, road and track disciplines - there are plenty of trophies and medals to be won! If you're after a London Marathon place, our club has one available each year, and participation in our club Summer Championship is the way to get it!

Beyond that, our members take part in all manner of races, both at home and abroad. Take a look at our events calendar to see where our members will be running!

## Training

We hold speedwork sessions every Tuesday evening and group runs every Thursday evening. We also hold marathon training sessions on Sunday mornings in the build up to the spring marathon season.

### Speedwork

Our speedwork sessions take place on Tuesday evenings at 7:00pm, usually on the track at the Manchester Regional Arena, but occasionally at the Longford Park Stadium.

Speedwork sessions are meant to be hard; you will need to push yourself, but you'll also get plenty of encouragement and support from everyone! We know that some people are faster than others, so our speed sessions are designed to be accessible to all abilities.

### Group runs

Our group runs take place every Thursday, starting at the Y Club at 6:30pm. After a quick warm up, the Captains will gather the group together for Club Notices, after which we’ll split into sub-groups before we head off on the run.

Each group will run at a different pace and will be led by a club member, so there should always be a pace group suited to you. The number of groups is flexible depending on the number of runners down on any particular night, but we’ll generally have the following four pace groups:

- Group 1: 7.00 min / mile (4.20 min / km) +/- 30 secs
- Group 2: 7.30 min / mile (4.40 min / km) +/- 30 secs
- Group 3: 8.30 min / mile (5.20 min / km) +/- 30 secs
- Group 4: 9.30 min / mile (5.50 min / km) +/- 30 secs

If you’re not sure which group to go in on your first visit, we'd advise starting off in Group 4 and try to work your way up to the next one!

Our routes are generally 6 - 8 miles (10 - 13km) but if you don't fancy running that far, we'll always offer a shorter alternative route of approximately 3 miles (5km).

## Committee

The Manchester YMCA Harriers Committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the club and making decisions that will affect the future of the club.

Everybody on the committee is a volunteer who gives their time freely for the benefit of the club and its members.
