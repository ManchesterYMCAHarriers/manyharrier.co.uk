The Manchester YMCA Harriers were established in 1882. We are one of the oldest running clubs in the UK, if not the world!

We are based at [the Y Club](/venues/the-y-club) in Manchester city centre.

Our club has been associated with [YMCA Manchester](https://www.ymcamanchester.org.uk) throughout its history. YMCA Manchester proudly provide training and education and health and wellbeing programmes to young people and communities across Manchester and Salford.

You can find out more information on their work and local activities at [ymcamanchester.org.uk](https://www.ymcamanchester.org.uk).

## Races and events

We have various [club championships](/championships), which cover cross-country, fell, road and track disciplines - there are plenty of trophies and medals to be won! If you're after a London Marathon place, our club has one available each year, and participation in our club Summer Championship is the way to get it!

Beyond that, our members take part in all manner of races, both at home and abroad. Take a look at our [events calendar](/events) to see where our members will be running!

## Training

We hold speedwork sessions every Tuesday evening and group runs every Thursday evening. We also hold marathon training sessions on Sunday mornings in the build up to the spring marathon season.
