description: The Manchester YMCA Harriers Welfare and Safeguarding Policy
---
## Mission statement
Everyone who takes part in athletics is entitled to participate in an enjoyable 
and safe environment. Manchester YMCA Harriers ("the Club") are committed to 
providing a safe, secure and respectful environment for its members to enjoy 
running regardless of age, disability, gender, ethnicity, gender identity, 
religion or belief and sexual orientation. 

This policy applies to all Club members and visitors at Club events; including 
training, races, social events and use of social media.

The Club supports, and expects members to support, the following:

* Promoting a culture of tolerance and mutual respect between members, and those 
  outside of the Club;
* Promoting fairness between members, regardless of personal difference and 
  athletic ability;
* Promoting a culture of diversity and inclusivity;
* Respecting the equal rights, dignity and privacy of every member;
* Respecting the facilities we use and the staff who work there; and
* A zero tolerance of bullying, harassment, discrimination or victimisation of 
  any kind.

## Welfare and safeguarding
Manchester YMCA Harriers believes no individual should experience fear, violence, 
abuse or bullying of any kind and we are committed to operating to ensure Club 
members are protected within Club activities. We aim to safeguard our members 
welfare within running activities, regardless of age, disability, gender, 
ethnicity, gender identity, religion or belief and sexual orientation.

It is assumed that all members are able to make their own decisions, unless 
information is brought to our attention that they are unable to do so. Club 
members should inform a Committee member ("[the Committee](/about/committee/)") 
of any significant change in their circumstances or wellbeing, either physical 
or mentally, which may impact their susceptibility to abuse or ability to 
participate in Club activities. 

## Responsibility as a Club member
It is everyoneâ€™s responsibility to protect the welfare of all those who 
participate in athletics at the Club. 

## Raising a concern
If you have a safeguarding issue or concerns about your own welfare, or that of 
anyone in the Club, please advise a member of the Committee as soon as reasonably 
possible.

If you believe there is an immediate and very real danger you should get in 
contact with the Police.

At all times, any concerns raised to the Committee will be treated in confidence 
with the privacy and dignity of those involved being paramount. 

## Once a concern has been raised
Following a report, the Committee will contact the UK Athletics Safeguarding 
Team for advice.

The UK Athletics Safeguarding Team will make a decision as to the level of 
concern. If the issue is deemed to be serious, the Police or relevant Local 
Authority will be notified.

If the issue is deemed to be less serious, it will be referred back to the 
Committee to be examined in accordance with the disciplinary procedure.

## Athletes under 18
The minimum age for membership of the Club is 18.

Children and young adults under the age of 18 cannot partake in Club activities 
or training sessions. 

## General complaints
If you have a complaint about the behaviour of another member of the Club, 
please raise this with the Committee. It will then be investigated in 
accordance with the [UK Athletics Club Discipline and Appeals Process](https://www.englandathletics.org/clubs-and-facilities/club-support-services/compliance-wellbeing/club-safeguarding-and-disciplinary-processes/).
