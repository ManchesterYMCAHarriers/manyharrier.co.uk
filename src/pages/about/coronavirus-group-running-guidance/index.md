description: Rules and guidance that applies to Manchester YMCA Harriers activities during the current coronavirus pandemic
---

## Introduction

In accordance with [England Athletics guidance issued on 28th May 2020](https://www.englandathletics.org/athletics-and-running/news/guidance-update-for-restricted-return-to-activity-for-coaches-leaders-athletes-runners-and-facilities-step-3/)
(including subsequent revisions), running club group road running activities can re-commence providing that any relevant
UK government policy and Public Health England (PHE) guidance on social distancing can be observed. This document sets
out how Manchester YMCA Harriers' road running club training sessions will be managed in accordance with these
conditions.

It is acknowledged that any return to participation in group running activity is entirely a personal decision, and each
individual member should carefully consider whether they believe it is safe to do so when making such decision.

## Changes to Road Running Training Sessions Following Covid-19 Risk Assessment

1. Anyone demonstrating symptoms or who suspects that they may be infected should follow Public Health England guidance
   and self-isolate. Under no circumstances should they attend a session.
1. Anyone who develops symptoms after a session should immediately inform the
   [Manchester YMCA Harriers' "Covid Coordinator"](/contact) so that other participants to the session may be informed.
1. Attendees at a group training session shall be limited such that each group leader shall supervise a maximum of 12
   per group.
1. The groups shall be made up of specific named attendees which must be recorded and fixed in advance of the session,
   on a first come, first served basis. A simple online sign-up system to record the attendees of the various groups
   has been established to facilitate this.
1. Each session must have a group leader who is familiar with the route. The leader does not need to be a committee
   member, but without a leader the group will not able to depart and must be cancelled before the session. The leader
   of each group must therefore also be confirmed in advance of the session.
1. The meeting points and routes may vary; these will be identified on the sign-up system.
1. The meeting points for each location shall provide ample space for Public Health England guidance on social
   distancing to be observed.
1. It should be assumed that there will be no changing facilities available at any of the locations unless government
   guidance permits the opening of such premises. It is advised that members arrive changed and ready to run without
   delay.
1. Members should not congregate before or after the session, promptly returning home after the run is completed.
1. The Public Health England guidance on social distancing should be observed, with group participants remaining 2
   metres apart at all times; before, during and after the session.
1. The dynamic warm up which is normally held before the training session will be temporarily suspended to reduce the
   risk of social contact. Runners should instead arrive prepared and ready to run without delay.
1. Running routes which are known to be busy areas for pedestrians (e.g. canal sections) shall not be selected for 
   training sessions for the time being, and so routes which are likely to be clear from congestion will be preferred 
   to reduce the risk of social contact.
1. Members are reminded of the need to exercise vigilance when on runs to avoid contact with other runners and members
   of the public, at all times.
