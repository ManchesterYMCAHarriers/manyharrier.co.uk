Clubs that are affiliated with UK Athletics are entitled to apply for places
in the London Marathon; the number of places a club receives depends on how
many affiliated members it has.

## Important note about our London Marathon place for 2020 and 2021
The Club has **not** been awarded a London Marathon place for 2020. We believe 
that we followed the correct procedure to apply for the place, however London
Marathon claim to have no record of our application. We realised too late that
we had not received the correspondence from London that we were expecting.

In spite of several desperate appeals to the London Marathon organisers - 
including visiting their offices in person and explaining the implications 
for the Club and on Ben Watson who the place had been awarded to - the London 
Marathon chose not to award the Club a place for 2020.

We will apply for a place for the 2021 London Marathon, which we will award to
Ben to make up for the disappointment of missing out in 2020. We expect normal
service to resume in 2022!

## Our normal process for awarding London Marathon places
We expect to be awarded one place for the London Marathon each year, which we 
invite our members to apply for.

Applications for the Club's London Marathon place should be made to the
Club Secretary before the end of November.  The Committee will award the place
to a member in early December. 

As you might expect, demand for the place within the club is high. As such, the
Committee award the place on the following basis:

1. **First preference** is given to members who have:
    - Completed that year's Club Summer Championship; and
    - Applied for a London Marathon place in the public ballot and have been
      rejected.

1. **Second preference** is given to members who have:
    - Completed that year's Club Summer Championship.
    
1. **Third preference** is given to any other member.

Where the Committee receives multiple applications of equal standing, a name
will be drawn from a hat.
