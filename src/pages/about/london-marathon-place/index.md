Each year, the Manchester YMCA Harriers are awarded one place for the London
Marathon. 

Applications for the Club's London Marathon place should be made to the
Club Secretary before the end of November.  The Committee will award the place
to a member in early December. 

As you might expect, demand for the place within the club is high. As such, the
Committee award the place on the following basis:

1. **First preference** is given to members who have:
    - Completed that year's Club summer championship; and
    - Applied for a London Marathon place in the public ballot and have been
      rejected.

1. **Second preference** is given to members who have:
    - Completed that year's Club summer championship.
    
1. **Third preference** is given to any other member.

Where the Committee receives multiple applications of equal standing, a name
will be drawn from a hat.
