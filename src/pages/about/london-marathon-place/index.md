Clubs that are affiliated with UK Athletics are entitled to apply for places in the London Marathon; the number of places a club receives depends on how many affiliated members it has.

## Important note about our London Marathon place for 2024/25
London Marathon changed the rules on allocation of club places in 2023 and the club did not have enough members to be allocated a guaranteed spot and were also unsuccessful in securing a place through the club ballot. Therefore there was **no place available** for the club in the 2024 race. 

It is hoped the club will meet the minimum requirement of members to secure a guaranteed spot for the 2025 London Marathon.

## The club process for awarding the London Marathon place
The Club accepts applications for the spot from any member. Any member can apply for themselves, or nominate another.

Applications for the Club's London Marathon place should be made to the Club Secretary before the end of November. The Committee will award the place to a member in early December.

As you might expect, demand for the place within the club is high. As such, the Committee award the place on the following basis:

1. **First preference** is given to first-claim members who have:
   - Completed that year's Club Summer Championship; and
   - Applied for a London Marathon place in the public ballot and have been rejected.

2. **Second preference** is given to first-claim members who have:
   - Completed that year's Club Summer Championship.

3. **Third preference** is given to any other first-claim member.

4. **Final preference** is given to second-claim members.

Where the Committee receives multiple applications of equal standing, a name will be drawn from a hat.
