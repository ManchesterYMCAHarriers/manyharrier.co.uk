## Session aim/goal

This session will focus on your acceleration technique, specifically we are looking 
at the work your legs do during acceleration. If you can find a friend to yell "go", 
you’ll also be working on your reaction skills too.            

## Target energy system 

You will be training your **lactic** energy system.

## Session warm up

Complete your own warm up to get ready for the session.  Include some exercises 
to slowly raise your heart rate appropriate for your level of fitness and the 
session you're about to follow.  Include some dynamic movement to gently increase 
the range of body movement. Use this time to think about the session, to prepare 
your mind for exercise and set your intention.

The main body of this session is a little shorter so you can go for an extended 
warm up if you want. As you’ll be accelerating quickly, make sure you are properly 
warmed up.

## Main session

We don’t need very far for this session, so mark yourself a 1 minute distance, but 
you probably won’t need it all. Read the full session before picking your spot and 
marking any distances. This session probably isn’t best on a wet day, so if the 
weather is poor perhaps have a go at the [acceleration within a continuous effort session](/sessions/acceleration-within-a-continuous-effort/), 
switching the focus to legs instead of arms. 

* Rep one is from a standing start - accelerate in a controlled manner over a 
  distance of about 20 to 30 meters. Hold the speed for a few seconds then 
  decelerate in a controlled manner. If you can have someone else to say "go",
  you’ll be working your reaction technique;
* Rep two is the same again just to get the feel for it;
* Rep three this time start from a kneeling position;
* Rep four, start from a sitting position;
* Rep five, start lying face down; 
* Rep six, same as five (just for fun);
* Rep seven, a final rep starting from a standing position again.

Give yourself lots of rest between each rep, you should feel fully recovered before 
you go again.  

Use your strongest leg to push up from the ground and to get started. Focus on 
keeping your legs working underneath your body. Think about trying to push the 
ground behind you as you accelerate. Land on the front half (ball) of your foot 
underneath your body and drive down and back.

## Session cool down

Gently bring your heart rate back down.  If you wish, include some gentle stretching. 

## Reflection

During the cool down take a few moments to think about how the session went.

* Did you enjoy it?
* Did you learn anything interesting about your running?
* How do your legs feel now?
* If you did this in public, did you get any strange looks?
