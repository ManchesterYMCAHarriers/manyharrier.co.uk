This is a 30-minute session, where we repeat the following pattern:

* **400m effort** (a full lap of the track)
* 100m walk/jog recovery (a quarter of a lap the track)
* **300m effort** (three-quarters of a lap the track)
* 100m walk/jog recovery (a quarter of a lap the track)
* **200m effort** (half of a lap the track)
* 100m walk/jog recovery (a quarter of a lap of the track)

So, a complete set will total three laps of the track (1200m).

Complete as many sets as you can in the 30 minutes.
