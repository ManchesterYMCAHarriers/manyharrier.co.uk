description: A track training session
---
This is a 30-minute session, where we repeat the following pattern:

* **1000m effort** (two and a half laps of the track)
* 400m walk/jog recovery (one lap the track)

So, a complete set will total three and a half laps of the track (1400m).

Complete as many sets as you can in the 30 minutes.
