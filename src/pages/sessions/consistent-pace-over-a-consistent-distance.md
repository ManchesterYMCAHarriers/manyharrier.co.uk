## Session aim/goal

This session will work on your overall fitness and running endurance.     

## Target energy system 

You will be training your **lactic** and **aerobic** energy systems.

## Session warm up

Complete your own warm up to get ready for the session.  Include some exercises 
to slowly raise your heart rate appropriate for your level of fitness and the 
session you're about to follow.  Include some dynamic movement to gently increase 
the range of body movement. Use this time to think about the session, to prepare 
your mind for exercise and set your intention.  

## Main session

Mark yourself a distance which takes around 3 minutes to easy run.

**Running at around your 5K pace**, complete one rep from your start marker to your 
end marker.

Walk back to the start to give yourself a really good rest; and then complete 
another rep.

Continue to follow this pattern and aim to keep going for around 30-40 minutes.  

## Session cool down

Gently bring your heart rate back down.  If you wish, include some gentle stretching. 

## Reflection

During the cool down take a few moments to think about how the session went.  

* Did you enjoy it?
* Did you learn anything interesting about your running?
* Do you enjoy running repeats in a different location to track?
* What other factors do you need to think about?
