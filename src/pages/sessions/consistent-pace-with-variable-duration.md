## Session aim/goal

This session will work on your overall fitness and running endurance. It will also 
have the added benefit of working on your running ABCs (agility, balance and 
coordination) - specifically switch backs.     

## Target energy system 

You will be training your **lactic** and **aerobic** energy systems.

## Session warm up

Complete your own warm up to get ready for the session.  Include some exercises 
to slowly raise your heart rate appropriate for your level of fitness and the 
session you're about to follow.  Include some dynamic movement to gently increase 
the range of body movement. Use this time to think about the session, to prepare 
your mind for exercise and set your intention.  

## Main session

Mark yourself a distance which takes around 1 minute to jog/easy run. 

* Your first rep is this distance once; 
* If it is warm, take a standing recovery for about half the time you were just 
  running.  If it is cold, you might want to take a walk recovery of one rep; 
* Rep two is to run this distance twice, including a controlled switch back/turn 
  at the halfway point;
* Rest for about half of the time you were just running; 
* Rep three (you guessed it) is three times this distance with two turns; 
* Rest for about half of the time you were just running;
* Go back to just one rep.

Continue with this pattern for around 30 minutes.  

For pace on this one do what feels right for your training this week, but pay 
attention to your agility/balance/coordination and technique on the switch back.  

## Session cool down

Gently bring your heart rate back down.  If you wish, include some gentle stretching. 

## Reflection

During the cool down take a few moments to think about how the session went.

* Did you enjoy it?
* Did you learn anything interesting about your running?
* Have you ever lost places/time on a switch back?
* Do you have a technique for tackling tight turns/corners?
* Did you use different techniques during this session?
