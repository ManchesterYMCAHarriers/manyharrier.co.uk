This is a 30-minute session, where you need to partner up with someone of a
similar ability.

The session consists of 600-metre efforts, followed by 200-metres of walk/jog
recovery. (i.e. One-and-a-half laps of effort, followed by half-a-lap recovery.)

Complete as many sets as you can in the 30 minutes.
