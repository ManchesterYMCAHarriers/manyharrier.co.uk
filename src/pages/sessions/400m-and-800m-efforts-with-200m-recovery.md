description: A track training session
---
In this session we repeat the following pattern:

* **400m effort** (a full lap of the track)
* 200m walk/jog recovery (half a lap the track)
* **800m effort** (two laps of the track)
* 200m walk/jog recovery (half a lap the track)

Most runners will be aiming to complete 3 or 4 sets during the session.
