description: A track training session

This is a 30-minute session, where we repeat the following pattern:

* **800m effort** (two laps of the track)
* 200m walk/jog recovery (half a lap the track)

So, a complete set will total two and a half laps of the track (1000m).

Complete as many sets as you can in the 30 minutes.
