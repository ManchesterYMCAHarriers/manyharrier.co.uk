description: A track training session
---
In this session we repeat the following pattern:

* **800m effort** (two laps of the track)
* 200m walk/jog recovery (half a lap the track)

So, a complete set will total two and a half laps of the track (1000m).

Most runners will be aiming to complete six sets during the session.
