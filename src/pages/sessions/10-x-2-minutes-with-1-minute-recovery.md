This speedwork session is 10 sets of two-minute intervals with 1 minute 
of recovery between each set. Each interval will be marked by a whistle.

You should aim to run the efforts at your “interval” pace, which is roughly your 
5K pace - you can calculate an accurate value at the 
[Jack Daniels' VDOT runing calculator](http://runsmartproject.com/calculator/). 
For the recoveries, you can stand, walk or jog - up to you! 

The session is aimed at improving your aerobic efficiency.
