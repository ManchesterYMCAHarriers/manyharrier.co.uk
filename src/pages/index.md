firstPanelBody: |
  We are affiliated to England Athletics and we frequently take
  part in races and other running events. We have club
  championships in cross-country, road, fell and track
  disciplines. We particularly enjoy taking part in events where
  we can run as a team!

  We're not just about running; we arrange regular socials in
  Manchester city centre and we are often found travelling further
  afield for weekend breaks or longer holidays.

  somewhere in between all three, we'd love for you to join us!

  part of it!
