We'll start processing your renewal right away!

## What happens now?

Our Club Secretary will renew your memebership with England
Athletics and in the next few weeks they will send you a pack which contains - 
amongst other things - your England Athletics membership card. Your membership 
card will have your England Athletics registration number on it, which you may 
need to provide when entering races to receive a discount.
