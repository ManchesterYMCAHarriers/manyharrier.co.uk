intro: |
  The 2020 Summer Championship consists of three road, three trail and three
  fell races, with a short, medium and long distance race for each terrain.
  
  You need to complete any five of the nine races in order to qualify for the
  championship.
  
  Entry for the Marple Trail 10K is open and has sold out well in advance in 
  previous years, so you are advised to enter now to avoid missing out. Entry is
  also open for the "It's a Piece of Cake 10K", the Grasmere Gallop, the Worsley
  Woods trail race and the Manchester Half Marathon.
  
  Entry links for the other fixtures will be added as and when they are 
  available, so keep checking this page!
