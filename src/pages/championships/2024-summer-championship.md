description: Our 2024 Summer Championship consists of nine races that take place between April and October 2024
intro: |
  The 2024 Summer Championship consists of three road, four trail and four
  fell races, with a short, medium and long distance race for each terrain.
  
  Note that we have added two additional races to the original list this year (the Black Knight Charge and Shelf Moor Fell Race) because
  the other events sold out extremely quickly and many members were not able to sign up in time.

  You need to complete any five of the eleven races in order to qualify for the championship.
