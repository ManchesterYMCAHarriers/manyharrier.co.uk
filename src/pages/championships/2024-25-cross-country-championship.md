## How championship standings are calculated
When calculating the club championship standings, the first consideration is an individual's qualification status: 

1) Those who have completed 5 races are ranked highest;
1) Those who have completed 5 races but could do so with the remaining number of races are ranked next;
1) Those who have completed less than 5 and do not have enough races left to finish 5 by the end of the season.
  
The second consideration is the number of points that an individual has, with
a **lower number of points being better**. Points are awarded based on your race position relative to other Harrier runners. 1 point is awarded for a first-place
finish, 2 points are awarded for a second-place finish, 3 points for third and
so on. Points are only awarded to those who have finished at least 5 races, and those who could do so by the end of the championship.

The points awarded will be recalculated as the championship progresses. So, if
an individual wins a race but then does not complete enough races to qualify,
the people finishing behind that person will be shifted up a place.

Where a person has completed more than the requisite number of races needed to
qualify, their points score will consist of **their best results**, with their worst results being discarded. This does not affect the award of points to other
runners; the result is only discarded for the individual - it is not discarded
when calculating the points awarded to others.

If runners are tied on points, the final consideration is their head-to-head 
performances - the person with more wins relative to those who they are tied
with on points is ranked highest.

If runners cannot be separated by head-to-head performances, the result is
given as a tie.
