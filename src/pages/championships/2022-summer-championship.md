description: Our 2022 Summer Championship consists of nine races that take place between April and October 2022
intro: |
  The 2022 Summer Championship consists of three road, three trail and three
  fell races, with a short, medium and long distance race for each terrain.
  
  You need to complete any five of the nine races in order to qualify for the
  championship.
  
  Note that the Marple Trail 10K is open and has sold out well in 
  advance in previous years, so you are advised to enter now to avoid missing 
  out.

  You will also notice that there is currently one missing fixture - this will
  be one of the Sale Sizzler 5K road races at Wythenshawe Park - we are waiting
  on information being published about these races and we will provide an update
  ASAP!
