intro: |
  The 2022 Summer Championship consists of three road, three trail and three
  fell races, with a short, medium and long distance race for each terrain.
  
  You need to complete any five of the nine races in order to qualify for the
  championship.
  
  Note that the Marple Trail 10K is open and has sold out well in 
  advance in previous years, so you are advised to enter now to avoid missing 
  out.

  The Sale Sizzler fixture list has now been released and the fixture on Thursday 28th July has been selected for
  our championship. This race also sells out in advance.
