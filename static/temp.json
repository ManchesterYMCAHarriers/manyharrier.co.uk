After a bright start the weather quickly turned to provide a cold and very wet finish for the Harriers who had braved the seaside to run the 13.1 miles. Mark Griffiths was the first Harrier home followed by Rob Kedian, Jon Paramour, Emma Parkin, Steph Goodchild, Mike O’Brien and then Steve Symons on the comeback trail ably supported by Miranda Clarke\n\nThen on Wednesday 15 May the first of the Horwich 5 series took place. There was a surprisingly large field for the event and the Harriers put in a sterling performance. The route for this event is a little hilly but very pretty and well worth a mid-week trip. With 3 more races to go in the series, we’d encourage everyone to turn out and take part. So far the standings are; Thomas Hyde, Mark Griffiths, Rob Kedian, Mike O’Brian and Steve Symons for the men and Emma Parkin and Steph Goodchild for the ladies.\n\n### Track\nThe 800m was held on 28 May. This was the second race of the track championship and while no one managed as quick a time as David Rudisha the race did see a number of PB’s being achieved with the trophies going to Thomas Hyde for the men and Emma Bedford for the ladies\n\n### Fell\nThe first two races of the fell championship were held in May; the Cake Race on Saturday 4th May and Vanessa Chapel on 22nd May. Both races had a great turn out from the club and it was fantastic to see a lot of first time fell runners from the club coming down to the races and performing so well at both events.\n\nClearly the promise of free cake had a galvanising effect on Mark Griffiths and Hannah Brierley who came home 1st for the club at the Cake Race. For the men the results were, Mark, Mike Symons, James Gu, Ian Manners and Steve Symons. For the ladies Hannah, Emma Parkin and Miranda Clarke.\n\nFor full details of all the runners and times from all the races please see the results pages",

Thomas Hyde put in an outstanding performance to come 3rd overall. Tom was closely followed by Mark Griffiths and then Hannah Brierley who was the 3rd overall lady.

It must have been a strange sight to the theatre goers and shoppers but we didn’t care, we were here to race!\n\nOur President, Steve Symons (aka “the King”) had devised a 5.25 mile route around the Quays / Media City to replace the Saddleworth 6. There was a great turn out from the Club and some very quick times were posted.\n\nMark Griffiths won the race closely followed by Neil Stephenson who gave him a real run for his money.

            "markdown": "We returned to Heaton Park for the first race of the South East Lancashire Cross Country League (SELCCL) of the 2013/14 season.\n\nThe SELCCL attracts a smaller number of clubs when compared with the Manchester Area Cross Country League (MACCL), however the Harriers were well-represented in both the senior ladies’ and senior mens’ races.\n\nThe ladies’ race set off at 1.50pm, with four Harriers present in the line-up. The course was slightly shorter than the MACCL race a few weeks previously, however it was equally tough, with the descent through the wooded area in the Dell Gardens being particularly churned up in places. The first Harrier home was Emma Rettig in 35:21, closely followed by Emma Bedford in 36:00 and Steph Goodchild in 37:12. Ruselle Meade did exceptionally well on her cross country debut, coming home in 49:00.\n\n2.30pm saw the start of the men’s race, which was actually a slightly longer course than the MACCL race a few weeks earlier. The fact that fewer runners took part in the SELCCL race did nothing to change the feeling of being an extra in a remake of Braveheart; there were a couple of shouts of “CHARGE!” as we descended down the first hill to add to the authenticity. Nobody appeared to be carrying any 13th century weaponry though, which is certainly an advantage when running in a cross country race.\n\nThe smaller field meant that there was much less in the way of flying elbows and jostling for position in the early stages of the race. The openness of the “Papal field” allowed some room for overtaking, however the lack of shelter at this section of the course meant that runners were faced with a deceptively strong headwind. A narrow and steep ascent through an area of woodland opens up onto a more gradual climb towards the highest point of the course, after which there is a comfortable section of level ground. The course narrows again as it negotiates two sections of woodland, the latter of which is the aforementioned Dell Gardens; the respite that this downhill stretch provides is tempered by the need to be on a constant lookout for exposed roots, branches and calf-deep mud. A level section along a metalled path leads onto the final part of the course, a relatively steep climb back up to the start. Of course, we got to enjoy all of this twice more before the finish!\n\nDavid Garner led the men home in 41:41, chased by Mark Griffiths in 42:19. Next in was yours truly in 43:32, finishing in wide-eyed fear that Tom Hyde would sprint past me at the death. As it was, Tom finished a few seconds behind in 43:45, on his return from injury. Next up was Richard Brailsford in 44:42, then Rob Kedian in 48:54 and James Gu in 50:46. Paul Cooper was the second veteran home in 51:32, knocking over a minute off his time from the shorter MACCL course. The impressive veteran performances continued with Geoff Cotterill, who shaved a mere four and a half minutes off his time from the MACCL to finish in 52:47. Elder statesman Jon Paramor followed with another significant improvement, finishing in 54:04 – the cheerleaders didn’t put him off as much this time! Jon was closely followed by Steve Symons in 54:41, which left Ian Manners to bring up the rear in 57:27.\n\nThe decent turnout was mirrored “in the stands”, with some vocal support along the finishing straight and a splendid selection of post-race refreshments on offer. The only problem on the day was the fabled Harriers tent, which was enjoying its trip to Heaton Park and steadfastly refused to go back into its bag! We managed to get it sort of packed in the end and in doing so saved JP from spending a night under the stars.",

There are 11 in total. This year our own race, Blackleach Park, will be included in the Grand Prix. If you compete in a Grand Prix race it counts towards your individual ranking in the league. You need to compete in 7 of 11 races to complete the league and there are various categories and prizes, as well as team awards.\n\nThe idea is to encourage local clubs to support each others races as well as instilling a competitive edge, similar to the competition you might find in the cross country leagues.\n\nThe Trotters 5 was at Smithills park in Bolton and was hosted by Burnden Road Runners. The course was trail and consisted of 2 laps around the park.\n\nIt was a relaxed start (I, for one, didn’t actually realise the race had started until other people started dashing off!) but we soon got going through the park and did a short spell around a local housing estate. We were then directed past a farm and up a hill at the edge of the park, before sprinting down the hill back to the start for the second lap. This meant there was a fast downhill finish which is always encouraging for a weary runner!\n\nThere was an excellent friendly atmosphere and a great turn out from a lot of the local clubs, in particular Bolton, Swinton and Astley & Tyldesley were out in force. We were treated at the end to a goody bag including an old favourite, a curly wurly!\n\nThe committee would really like to encourage people to support the Central Lancs races and it would be great to have a few Harriers complete the league. There are 9 races remaining, however, one of these is our own race which Harriers cannot run (we need the numbers for marshals!), so there are 8 races remaining for Harriers to compete in. There is still a chance to get the 7 races in to complete the series for plenty of people!\n\nEven if you are unlikely to finish the league please do support the races you can make. We are hoping that the membership of the Grand Prix will really boost our numbers at Blackleach Park, which is an important event for the Harriers fundraising for the year. We would like to make sure we are supporting the races of other clubs in return.\n\nThe next race in the series is the Radcliffe 10k on Sunday 27 April 2014.

            "markdown": "The cross country season is nearly upon us so here’s a bit of information about what it entails…\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe Wikipedia definition is sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain. Essentially, this is the winter off-road sport in which we compete not only individually but also as a club.\n\nIn cross country the men and women run in separate races with different start times.\n\n## Who do we compete with?\n\nWe usually compete in 2 leagues – the Greater Manchester League and the South East Lancs League. However, this year we are yet to hear if South East Lancs League will go ahead. The Manchester League as you might expect is made up of a number of local clubs (as well as some slightly less local ones) so it’s a good chance to see what everyone else is doing.\n\nThere are also single Greater Manchester, Northern and National championship races where we compete with clubs in the north and across the country.\n\n## How are we ranked?\n\nTo complete the Manchester league you must run 4 of the 5 races. You will then be given an individual ranking in the league comprised of your best 4 results.\n\nWe also compete as team. To have a qualifying men’s team we need 6 runners for a race. For a qualifying women’s team it’s 4 runners. The top runners per race will count towards the team and an overall position on the day.\n\nAs with the individual rankings, we need to have fielded a team in 4 of the 5 races to qualify for a position overall.\n\nSo even if you don’t plan to finish the league it’s good to turn up to the races you can do as you may help contribute to one of the team places.\n\n## What about the club championship?\n\nWe also hold a club championship for members to compete with each other. The usual trophies for the top 6 women and top 6 men are available. The championship is scored in the same way as the road and fell.\n\nTo qualify you need to complete 4 of 7 possible races. The qualifying races this year are the 5 Manchester league races, the Northern Championships and the National Championships.\n\n## Where is it?\n\nThe races are in local parks around Manchester. This year’s locations are Woodbank Park (Stockport), Sherdley Park (St Helens), Boggart Hole Clough (Blackley), Heaton Park and Wythenshawe Park.\n\nThe races are hosted by local clubs. As the Harriers do not host a race (many of the clubs don’t) we are usually asked to provide a few marshals for one of the races.\n\nThe venue for the Northern champs is yet to be confirmed but the National will be at Parliament Hill in London!\n\n## What is the terrain?\n\nExpect mud, mud and more mud. The races tend to be over grass and through wooded areas with some up and down sections (nothing like a fell race – just undulating).\n\n## How far is it?\n\nThe women usually run between 4-6 miles and the men between 5-7 miles. For the National and the Northern the distances are slightly longer.\n\n## When are the races?\n\n11 October 2014 – Woodbank Park\n8 November 2014 – Sherdley Park\n6 December 2014 – Boggart Hole Clough\n7 January 2015 – Heaton Park\n24 January 2014 – Northern Champs, Venue TBC\n7 February 2015 – Wythenshawe Park\n21 February 2015 – National Champs, Parliament Hill\nWe are also hoping for a men and women’s team for the Manchester University Cross Country Relays on 25 October 2014. Date for Greater Manchester Champs is TBC, it’s usually the first weekend of January.\n\n## What time does it start?\n\nFor the Manchester League the women’s race starts at 1.40pm and the men’s race at 2.30pm.\n\n## What kit do I need?\n\nAs I have mentioned there is quite a lot of mud involved! Ideally, it would be wise to invest in some cross country spikes. These are lightweight shoes with spikes for grip in the mud. They tend to be cheaper than a normal running shoe – you can pick up a pair for between £30-£50.\n\nIf you haven’t got spikes at the very least you need a pair of trainers with good grip such as a trail or fell shoe. What you wear clothing wise will depend on how much you like the cold!\n\nIt is advisable to bring some waterproof shoes/wellies, lots of warm clothes and a waterproof coat to wrap up in for before and after the race. We encourage the women to support the men once they have finished and vice versa. This is part of the fun but it can get cold when you are standing around cheering.\n\nSnacks and chocolate are also greatly appreciated when shared with your fellow runners!\n\n## How do I enter?\n\nThere is a sign-up sheet on the board for those who wish to participate. The club has to pay an affiliation fee to the league by the end of the month so the deadline to sign up is 18 September 2014.\n\nThe fee is £20 which covers your entry to all the Manchester League races, the Northern and the National. It’s then up to you which ones you want to do but we hope people will come to as many as possible.\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you have any questions at all about cross country please speak to me or Mark at one of the training nights and we will be happy to answer any queries.\n\n— Hannah Brierley, Co-Captain",

We hold regular weekly group runs where we run together along pre-planned routes.\n\nThere are a number of different groups, running at different speeds and distances. We cater to every standard; from complete beginners to experienced marathon runners.\n\nWe run every Thursday meeting at the Y Club, Liverpool Street, Manchester. We meet at 6.30pm in the reception of the gym.\n\nWe also train on a Tuesday at the track at Sportcity, next to the Etihad Stadium.\n\nOn Thursday 30th October 2014 we are holding a **new runners evening**. This is to welcome anyone who might be interested in joining the club. You can join us for a taster session to see if the club will suit you, with no obligation to join.\n\nWe will be meeting on Thursday 30th October 2014 at 6.30pm in the Y Club reception. We will take you out on one of our routes around Salford Quays. We will then return to the Y Club to change and go for a drink in the Castlefield Hotel bar (optional!).\n\nIf you would like to see how far you can take your running, or see if you like running at all, please come along to the session.\n\nIf you are interested in attending please email Hannah Brierley (h.brierley@hotmail.co.uk) or Mark Griffiths (mcgriffiths2000@yahoo.co.uk) who will be happy to answer any queries and put your name down for the session.\n\n**We look forward to welcoming you!**\n\n— The Manchester YMCA Harriers",

The final cross country races are drawing near and we are looking forward to a new running season.\n\nHere are a few reminders/details of what’s going on over the coming months.\n\n### Marathon Training\n\nNow in full swing with long runs going at 10am from the Y club on Sunday. Usually two groups with regular looping points to catch up. Mark has put together a helpful training plan with details of the long runs.\n\nIf you are targeting a specific time and want a more bespoke training plan Steve Symons can help put one together for you.\n\nYou don’t need to be training for a marathon, if you have a distant event coming up or just fancy a long run please do feel free to join us.\n\n### Central Lancs Grand Prix\n\nThe first race of the Grand Prix is the Central Lancashire 5K on 15 February 2015, hosted by Bolton Harriers. I know we keep saying it but we are really keen for Harriers to support the races given the support we had in September for Blackleach. Check out the Central Lancashire GP website for full list of all the fixtures.\n\nIf you fancy a new challenge why not aim to complete the league and race others at local clubs. The Grand Prix produce a league table, you need to complete 7 out of 10 races to qualify. Remember Harriers cannot compete in our own race at Blackleach Park, which forms one of the 10 (we need the marshalls!).\n\n### Road & Fell Championships\n\nThe fixtures have now been circulated. The first road race, the Trafford 10k, is on 8 March 2015; unfortunately, the race is already full!\n\nRemember, you need 6 of 10 to complete the road (or 5 plus a marathon) and 5 of 9 for the fell. Within your qualifying races you must have a short, medium and long.\n\n### Track\n\nGoing strong as ever and run by Steve. If you haven’t been before and fancy giving it a go please do let one of us know – fun, fast sessions catering to all abilities.\n\nThe track championship also takes place over summer with trophies awarded to the winners of all races. Not taken too seriously, we are not very good at sprinting.\n\n### Kit\n\nIf you need anything please see Mark Griffiths.\n\n### Membership Renewal\n\nComing up as usual in May 2015. Information will be circulated in due course but FYI England Athletics have increased their fees again.\n\nIf you are a social member of the Y club, you can now pay by monthly direct debit of £5 a month.\n\n### New Members\n\nWe love to see them so please do bring anyone you know who is interested in running along to one of the sessions.\n\n### Feedback\n\nIf you have any suggestions/queries/comments please do speak to one of the committee – we welcome all feedback.\n\nWishing you all a successful summer season.\n\n— Hannah Brierley",

            "markdown": "It might seem early, but the committee have been discussing the 2015/16 cross country season already and, given the weather we’ve had recently, it feels like it’s already time to start running around in the mud.\n\nWe’re really excited about this years’ season and we’re hoping to build on the success and performances from last year.\n\nFor those of you who are new to the club (or any who have forgotten!) the cross country races take place in parks around the Manchester area. The terrain is usually undulating and over grass or through woodland areas. The distances are around 4-6 miles for the ladies and 5-7 miles for the men.\n\nAll the races take place in the afternoon, so no early starts!\n\nThe key thing you should know about cross country is it is predominantly a **TEAM event**. Yes, we run an individual championship within the club, but the great thing about cross country is we are ranked on our team place within the leagues we compete in.\n\nThis means that every runner, no matter how fast or slow, whatever your experience, can help contribute to the success of the team in the cross country league. One of the big things you can do to improve the team is just **SHOW UP AND RUN**. We are very good at that.\n\nUsually, we need 4 runners to field a women’s team and 6 runners to field a men teams. There are occasions when we don’t have enough runners on the day to field a team. Again, no matter what your standard of running, we would much rather have a full team present than not have enough runners to count. So if you’re worried about your capabilities, please don’t be.\n\nOne of the other benefits of cross country is the men and women run separately. This means you usually always have supporters along the way during the race. Personally, one of my favourite things about cross country is cheering on the men after we have done our race (for the ladies we have the added benefit of feeling smug as we have already finished). We are known to have a particularly loud cheering squad (Jen has previously made pom poms) although we are now facing some tough competition from the Chorlton Runners.\n\nIn terms of the Championship, we’re back to the old format of having the Manchester League and the South East League to count. This means there are 9 qualifying races and you will need to complete 5 of them to finish the championship. There are prizes up for grabs for the first 6 men and women in the club championship.\n\nOur main aim is to finish both of these leagues having fielded enough runners each race to count for a team place, with the result that we have teams finishing in both leagues.\n\nWe had some brilliant results last year, particularly in the men’s team which is going from strength to strength. We really feel we can make an impact this year and hopefully end up with some good team results. There is a great opportunity to do well in the South East Lancs League which is smaller and doesn’t have the same competition from the very big clubs with hundreds and hundreds of runners.\n\nIf you have any questions about kit, the races or any queries at all please do speak to me or Mark; we are happy to talk you through it. If you have any trouble with travelling to races we can usually arrange lifts and the majority of the races are local to Manchester.\n\nThere will be an email going round in the near future with the details if you want to enter the cross country races. It’s £20 for all the races in the Manchester and South East Lancs League if you let JP know you want to enter before the deadline – a bargain!\n\nI have copied the provisional dates below.

            "markdown": "For most people April means the start of spring, longer days and Easter eggs. However for some people it means the culmination of 4 months of hard work, quiet Saturday nights in and Sunday morning long runs.\n\nThis April eleven Manchester YMCA Harriers ran 26.2 miles to complete marathons in Paris, Manchester and London. Whether it is your first marathon, a new personal best or another medal to add your collection it is a fantastic achievement that should be celebrated. A big well done goes to Craig, Richard, Chris, Hannah, Sarah, Emma and Jon for running 26.2 miles this month. An even bigger congratulations goes to Jill, Inger and Francesca for running their first ever marathon.\n\nOn the 3rd April 2016 I crossed the finish line to complete the Paris marathon with mixed emotions. This was my 6th marathon since joining the Harriers, but it was the first time I had not improved on my previous time. I have been a bit spoilt since joining the club expecting new PBs every season, but it wasn’t long ago that the thought of running anything more than a 10k sounded impossible and something I didn’t even want to try.\n\nFor all runners training for a marathon is tough. It doesn’t matter what pace you run the build-up of long runs mixed in tempo runs, track sessions, recovery runs and practice races take their toll on your body and mind. For 16 weeks training gradually takes over your life, not only does everything start to ache, but you start to think or talk about running more often than is probably healthy.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/12/paris3.jpg)\n\nThis why being a member of the club has helped so much; running with other people has made training fun or at least bearable. It is very difficult to make long runs along the muddy banks of the river Mersey on a wet Sunday morning in February enjoyable! I think the end of marathon training is one of the reasons for my mixed feelings. The support and team spirit of training together and then celebrating together makes being a member of the YMCA Harriers so special to me. It is one the main reasons I enjoying running so much.\n\nThe Paris Marathon itself was an incredible event with over 40,000 runners following a spectacular route. I was told that the course was ‘pancake flat’. This is not true. Not that there is any steep hills or the reason why I didn’t ran as fast as I wanted.\n\nThe race starts on the Champs-Élysées and heads out to Place de La Concorde. Then it follows along the Rue de Rivoli passing by Le Jardin des Tuileries, the Louvre Museum and La Place de la Bastille. From there runners cross Bois de Vincennes Park and head back to La Bastille via Rue de Charenton.\n\nThe race follows the River Seine, with beautiful views from the Île de la Cité, Pont Neuf, Musée d’Orsay and Eiffel Tower. The last 10km passes by the Bois de Bolougne Park until reaching the finish line at Rue de Foch. For those people who really want to enjoy the race there are plenty of opportunities to stop and take in the views and landmarks (maybe to even take a selfie with the Eiffel Tower in the background!). Even someone as competitive and overly serious as me managed to appreciate the stunning course.\n\nIt was all going so well, I even smugly remarked on route a couple of times how close I was to my target time. It wasn’t until around mile 20 that the pain really started. It is common story of effort levels increasing, but your pace dropping. That horrible feeling caused by other runners passing you as if you are standing still. The last couple of miles dragged as the temperature rose and rose. It wasn’t just me; Craig, Richard, Chris and Hannah were all disappointed with their times and were expected to run faster.\n\nThe conditions and possibly the occasion had affected us all. It made me think would I swap this experience for running 1 minute 16 seconds faster somewhere else. Being able to run somewhere so stunning, cheered on by 1000s of enthusiastic supporters and then sharing the experience with such a great group of people really was special. The best cold beer I’ve ever tasted at the finish line may have helped too. So maybe there is more to running a marathon than just the time and anyway there is always next year…\n\n— Mark Griffiths\n\n### Results\n\n* Mark Griffiths, Paris 2.46.15\n* Craig Jones, Paris – 2.52.21\n* Richard Brierley, Paris – 3.11.21\n* Chris March, Paris – 3.13.29\n* Hannah Brierley, Paris – 3.34.59\n* Jill Guthrie, Paris – 4.39.54 **(First marathon)**\n* Sarah Crandon, Manchester – 3.40.41 **(Personal Best)**\n* Emma Rettig, London – 3.42.52 **(Personal Best)**\n* Jon Paramor, London – 3.52.17\n* Inge Lingrasmo, London – 4.47.33 **(First marathon)**\n* Francesca Norris, London – 56.14 **(First marathon)**",

            "markdown": "In October, 1964 as a fifteen year old school boy I joined Manchester YMCA Harriers in what was to become a lifetime of sheer enjoyment. However, my introduction to races began at primary school. My first certificate reads: Prestwich and Whitefield Town Sports 1957, Second in the boys obstacle race. Certificates followed for flat races, obstacle races, potato races, egg and spoon, sack etc. up to 1960. The highlight of remembrances at this time was being part of the school winning relay team of 4 × 100 yards. In 1959, qualification for the team was simple – a number of us were herded down to the local park one lunch time. A race was set in motion and the first four were picked. From there we were given kit, a race order and details for race day. No training! No tactics! Just run! **IT WORKED!**\n\n![](/content/images/2016/12/dashton1.jpg)\n\nI was thrilled with this achievement on two counts. Firstly, it was a first team prize and secondly, I had qualified a year younger than the others.\n\nLooking back on this photo what strikes me now is not the typical northern scene in black and white but the kit. The school T-shirt was one size fits all and for someone my height it needed to be rolled up and pinned to the shorts. If not it was down below knee level which quite restricts running action. Also the shirt was used for all sports in all weathers. We were either brave or most likely stupid. The shorts were made by mum and will appear later in these memories. The pumps were big sisters hand downs and the socks … well, least said the better. When one considers today’s kit the amount we use and the technical research that has gone into it – well, how times have changed.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/12/dashton2.jpg)\n\nHere we are again, May 1965. (Recognise the shorts?) – things were made to last in those days. Although Jack my opponent is wearing a Bury and Radcliffe kit and I’m in a club training top the event is actually the 880 yards in the school Town Sports. This is one of my proudest achievements for I’d never beaten Jack before. He was a much stronger runner than myself but I had the ace card of a sprint finish – looking at my facial expression it certainly doesn’t seem so. I remember being thoroughly motivated by Roger Bannister’s book on the first sub 4 minute mile and how he used his sprint finish to great effect in races. With the aid of school pals leading at the start for the first 220 yards I then sat in behind Jack and clung on till 100 yards to go then **WOOSH!** Everything went to plan I zoomed past Jack then exhaustion kicked in and I had to grind out those last few yards – hence the facial expression.\n\nAs an aside to the Roger Bannister reference. Following his 3:59.4 achievement John Landy, an Australian, took the time down to 3:57. Later that year (1954) they raced at the Empire Games in Vancouver. Imagine the setting the only two men ever to break the four-minute mile racing against each other. It was a great race with Bannister using his favoured tactics to sprint to victory. For years this story thrilled and excited me from just reading the book. It is only in recent years that I’ve seen the actual race on You Tube and it doesn’t disappoint. I can’t help wondering if that race was fast forwarded to 2016 and the massive hype and publicity, not to mention monetary gain, that would have surrounded the event.\n\nApologies if I’ve gone on somewhat but, as you’ve guessed, he is one of my heroes.\n\nBack to the script.\n\nSchool days.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1964 I raced in many school events with no preparation or training. We just went to the event.\n\nLooking back now I can’t help wondering if my paper-boy delivery round didn’t act as a basic fitness programme. I started this as a ten year old. Interestingly the law said you had to be fourteen but no-one checked. The pay was 16 shillings a week (80p for all you post 1971 readers), and was useful in saving up for a bike. Three memories stand out from this job:\n\n1. My mum deserves mention for rising early and making the porridge.\n2. Wearing a balaclava and duffel coat I must have looked a real thug long before the days of “hoodies”.\n3. Returning home with blackened face in days of fog and smog and the polluted air that must have been inhaled.\n\nBack to school races. For all you younger readers who are sick of hearing from us oldies how life was great in our day, consider this. The maximum distance we raced was 220 yards at age 12, 440 yards aged 13 and 880 yards aged 14. It wasn’t till 1964 that the mile was introduced. **WHAT WHIMPS WE WERE.**\n\nTo finish Part 1 of these memories I’ll reference races through the Air Cadets. Yes I was a cadet – useless at drill, shooting in fact any kind of military challenge. However, my running ability gave me a little street cred whilst a member of 1005 Radcliffe and Whitefield squadron. Races were held for East Lancashire squadrons. If successful here you progressed to the Western Region at RAF Cosford and from here a first place meant the National Finals at RAF Uxbridge. In 1964 and 65 I won at East Lancs but only came second at Cosford. In 1966 I progressed to RAF Uxbridge but was disappointed with my third placing. This meant I had one last chance before age barred me from competing. The reason this is included in my memories is because it was the first time I concentrated on a specific race on a specific date and set forth on a training programme with that goal. 1967 then – first in the mile and 880 yards at the East Lancs and Western Region. National finals – everything gambled on the 880 yards. Yes! Success at last! I used the same tactics as those against Jack in 1965 and with exactly the same result.\n\nAn interesting aside to this story. When my mum was suffering from terminal cancer in late 1983 she looked through my medal collection. She picked out the Piccadilly marathon medal of that year as her favourite. I was devastated. Firstly, the medal was not won but given for finishing and I hated the event and have never run a marathon since. But, secondly, what really hurt was that my pride and joy of a national title gold medal was not the chosen one. Such is life.\n![](/content/images/2016/12/dashton3.jpg)\n\nTo finish part one I’ll reference this photograph. I’m sure you’ve all experienced bizarre injuries and the stories association with them. Well how’s this: on winning the mile race at RAF Cosford in 1967 the finishing tape got caught on my throat. I shouted my feelings to the boys holding the tape no doubt in choice language (certainly not for repeating here). Imagine my disgust when I was seriously reprimanded and put on a charge for my outburst. The photo shows me in the medics office the next day. The scar remained for weeks and for a number of years appeared each time I got hot. It just shows athletics has its downside, too.\n\n— David Ashton, May 2016",

Interestingly the law said you had to be fourteen but no-one checked. The pay was 16 shillings a week (80p for all you post 1971 readers), and was useful in saving up for a bike. Three memories stand out from this job:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My mum deserves mention for rising early and making the porridge.  </li>\n<li>Wearing a balaclava and duffel coat I must have looked a real thug long before the days of “hoodies”.  </li>\n<li>Returning home with blackened face in days of fog and smog and the polluted air that must have been inhaled.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Back to school races. For all you younger readers who are sick of hearing from us oldies how life was great in our day, consider this. The maximum distance we raced was 220 yards at age 12, 440 yards aged 13 and 880 yards aged 14. It wasn’t till 1964 that the mile was introduced. <strong>WHAT WHIMPS WE WERE.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To finish Part 1 of these memories I’ll reference races through the Air Cadets. Yes I was a cadet – useless at drill, shooting in fact any kind of military challenge. However, my running ability gave me a little street cred whilst a member of 1005 Radcliffe and Whitefield squadron. Races were held for East Lancashire squadrons. If successful here you progressed to the Western Region at RAF Cosford and from here a first place meant the National Finals at RAF Uxbridge. In 1964 and 65 I won at East Lancs but only came second at Cosford. In 1966 I progressed to RAF Uxbridge but was disappointed with my third placing. This meant I had one last chance before age barred me from competing. The reason this is included in my memories is because it was the first time I concentrated on a specific race on a specific date and set forth on a training programme with that goal. 1967 then – first in the mile and 880 yards at the East Lancs and Western Region. National finals – everything gambled on the 880 yards. Yes! Success at last! I used the same tactics as those against Jack in 1965 and with exactly the same result.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting aside to this story. When my mum was suffering from terminal cancer in late 1983 she looked through my medal collection. She picked out the Piccadilly marathon medal of that year as her favourite. I was devastated. Firstly, the medal was not won but given for finishing and I hated the event and have never run a marathon since. But, secondly, what really hurt was that my pride and joy of a national title gold medal was not the chosen one. Such is life. <br />\n<img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/dashton3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>To finish part one I’ll reference this photograph. I’m sure you’ve all experienced bizarre injuries and the stories association with them. Well how’s this: on winning the mile race at RAF Cosford in 1967 the finishing tape got caught on my throat. I shouted my feelings to the boys holding the tape no doubt in choice language (certainly not for repeating here). Imagine my disgust when I was seriously reprimanded and put on a charge for my outburst. The photo shows me in the medics office the next day. The scar remained for weeks and for a number of years appeared each time I got hot. It just shows athletics has its downside, too.</p>\n\n<p>— David Ashton, May 2016</p>",

The views, oh the lovely views! They say a picture paints a thousand words so here are some photos from a couple of races that made the effort worthwhile to tempt you.\n\n1.

Most of you know I am appalling at the technical downs on fell races but there is a certain joy in throwing yourself down a grassy verge or thundering downhill on the road.

If so here are some of my top tips for making life on the hill easier gathered from the wisdom of other Harriers, reading too many running magazines/books and a bit of experience\n\n1. Think about your form. I believe (along with countless other runners) that a shorter stride with a rapid turnover is more efficient on a hill. Keep your head up and eyes focused ahead, if you’re hunched over you can’t get as much oxygen to your lungs and you’re going to need all the oxygen you can get!\n\n1. Get your arms moving as hills aren’t just about using your legs – if your arms are moving your legs will have to follow. Pump your arms and use their force to get you to the top.\n\n1. Use your head. Your mind is a powerful tool and can be just as valuable as a strong pair of legs to get you through a tough run. One of my favourite tricks is picturing a handsome Hollywood star or indie rock god pushing me up the hill. It’s amazing how much visualising a big, strong pair of arms driving you to the top helps. Alternatively be The Little Engine That Could and employ a positive frame of mind – I think I can, I think I can… Find what works for you and use it.\n\n1. Put your ego aside. Mentally it might feel better to race the whole hill but sometimes the smarter move is to slow down or even walk. You need to control your breathing and conserve your energy for the rest of the race. This is especially true on the fell where the hills can be calf cripplingly steep and walking is the only way for us mere mortals to reach the summit. For the mountain gods amongst you, you probably scamper up and already love hills so this article is wasted on you anyway!\n\n1.

Great for academic possibilities but a real problem for a sports lover because school teams were under-15’s and age barred me from these.\n\nQuestion: What does one do faced with this problem?\nAnswer: Join a running club.\n\nQuestion: What’s the first move?\nAnswer: Speak to the P.E. teacher and get a list of local clubs.\n\nConfronted with this list I picked out Manchester YMCA Harriers and sent off for details. From the very first I was made to feel welcome and part of a team. This latter proved very important because a) I was the only youngster and, b) it was not the most successful of clubs. My first run in October 1964, at the club still carries distinct memories. I was met at the Peter Street headquarters and taken to the club training ground on Princess Parkway. The run was two laps, of 3 mile on the road. Considering I’d never run on the road and never covered more than two or three miles cross-country it proved a steep learning curve. Despite this I soon became familiar with harrier running and competed for the club as a Youth, Junior and Senior from 1964 to 1970. The season’s fixture programme was very different than today’s all year race calendar. The winter months were the only programmed fixtures. We were part of the Manchester cross-country league which consisted of four races and there were championship races for the East Lancs, Northern and National. Vacant Saturdays consisted of Pack Runs from Moss Nook and taking in the countryside round Manchester Airport.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/12/dashton2_01.jpg)\n\n_**Above:** Manchester YMCA Harriers at the start of a Pack Run in the 1960’s.

We don’t exactly look the mean and lean figures of harrier running but enjoyment and comradeship was high on the agenda._\n\nRoad relays usually 4 x 3 mile were very popular at the start and finish of the cross-country season and were really enjoyable events. Most clubs staged them including the YMCA who used their 3 mile training loop. The Longendale event was staged by Salford Harriers and because of it’s geographical location attracted top clubs from Manchester, West Yorkshire and Staffordshire.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/12/dashton2_02.jpg)\n\n_**Above:** Competing in the Longendale relay, September 1969. The cyclist is pure coincidence – I was not being paced, HONEST!_\n\nManchester YMCA Harriers did not cater for track athletics in a serious way and this was a problem because that was by far my favourite form of running. I was invited to track sessions at Bolton under the direction of Terry Nortley and this led to a situation of racing for Bolton on the track and the YMCA at harrier events.\n\nIn Autumn, 1970, I joined Bolton United Harriers as a first claim member and consequently experienced athletics where the basic aim was achievement of self and team. In my years at Bolton I was primarily part of the track team and only ever on the fringes of those great harrier teams of the 60’s and 70’s with runners of the stature of Ron Hill, Mike Freary and Steve Kenyon. I loved the track sessions and although we regularly trained to exhaustion it remains my favourite type of training. Many of you will have experienced Steve Symons excellent sessions and the benefits these bring. My favourite session was 12 x 200m in teams of two. We were paired with a runner of equal ability. One runner started half-way along the straight and ran to their partner on the opposite straight. Once you had handed over the recovery was a jog across the track ready for the incoming runner. It was lung bursting because you had to be in position ready for the in-coming runner.\n\nOn Sunday mornings the track team trained round Entwistle reservoir between Bolton and Blackburn. These, too, carry great memories. As well as runs around the reservoir we did hill-reps in the forests and reps up the steps of the dam-head embankment. Running on pine needles and their soft cushioning impact remains my favourite ever running surface. The reps up the dam’s head carry different memories – those 147 steps still give me nightmares. Sadly I have barely any photographs of my Bolton days. However, two newspaper cuttings best highlight my memories of being part of a top club.\n\n![Bolton Evening News - March 1971](/content/images/2016/12/dashton2_03.jpg)\n\n_Bolton Evening News – March 1971_\n\n![Manchester Evening News - March 1973](/content/images/2016/12/dashton2_04.jpg)\n\n_Manchester Evening News – March 1973_\n\nBoth articles are correct but each has a story behind the report.\n\nThe two races cover my best and worst performance for the club. In the medley relay it is true I was overtaken within yards of receiving the baton in first place. What the report doesn’t highlight is the disgust and annoyance I could sense from the Bolton support even whilst running. For the first lap there were token cheers and encouragement. As the race progressed and it was clear I was “sitting-in” on the lead runner those cheers loudened with shouts of “you can do it!”, “use your strength!” and “take him!, take him!”. Remember I’ve already stated races were about achievement of self and club. (How different to the raucous cheers from our lady members who shout encouragement following their race in cross-country races. These cheers are for all standards).\n\nThe second report is again factually true but really does carry a story behind it. My services were called upon on the Thursday before Saturday’s race. It was before the days of emails and texts and as we didn’t have a phone at home the message came through from the team manager at work. The race was very important as Bolton needed to finish in the first six to qualify for the National Championships. Our team was considerably weakened by injuries and Ron Hill racing in a marathon in Athens. We travelled as a team on the Friday and stayed overnight at Newcastle University. Once settled in a team meeting was called and the twelve runners were given a race order and a six or three mile leg. I was to run the three mile, sixth leg. An early start Saturday on the short journey to Morpeth to look over the course and further discuss tactics. With the race underway I took over in third place and by the end of my leg I had dropped down to sixth. From this point I was not flavour of the month. (I now appreciate how own goals and penalty misses affect footballers). Luckily everything turned out well and a second place finish was an excellent result for the club.\n\nThis is where I went from zero to hero and I got all the plaudits from media coverage because mine made a good story. It is ironic that I got a Northern Counties silver award for this, my poorest race for the club, and a six-pack of lager for my finest in the medley relay. This difference is compounded for someone who doesn’t drink. Needless to say my services were not required for the National Championships.\n\nReading this I hope I’ve not given the impression that my Bolton career was fraught. It was not and I loved the experience of running at a top club, and knowing I’d achieved my full capabilities.\n\nI’ll finish part 2 with an anecdote of how crazy runners can get. In 1971 a small group of Bolton track athletes travelled to a relay meeting in Edinburgh. Nothing unusual here you’ll be thinking. However, the only reason was to say we had run on a tartan track. Nowadays these are common and every park seems to have them. In 1971 there were only two in the country – Crystal Palace and Edinburgh. I’m sure you’ll agree its this “craziness” that makes ours such a great sport to be part of.\n\n&mdash; David Ashton, July 2016",

We don’t exactly look the mean and lean figures of harrier running but enjoyment and comradeship was high on the agenda.</em></p>\n\n<p>Road relays usually 4 x 3 mile were very popular at the start and finish of the cross-country season and were really enjoyable events. Most clubs staged them including the YMCA who used their 3 mile training loop. The Longendale event was staged by Salford Harriers and because of it’s geographical location attracted top clubs from Manchester, West Yorkshire and Staffordshire.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/dashton2_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Above:</strong> Competing in the Longendale relay, September 1969. The cyclist is pure coincidence – I was not being paced, HONEST!</em></p>\n\n<p>Manchester YMCA Harriers did not cater for track athletics in a serious way and this was a problem because that was by far my favourite form of running. I was invited to track sessions at Bolton under the direction of Terry Nortley and this led to a situation of racing for Bolton on the track and the YMCA at harrier events.</p>\n\n<p>In Autumn, 1970, I joined Bolton United Harriers as a first claim member and consequently experienced athletics where the basic aim was achievement of self and team. In my years at Bolton I was primarily part of the track team and only ever on the fringes of those great harrier teams of the 60’s and 70’s with runners of the stature of Ron Hill, Mike Freary and Steve Kenyon. I loved the track sessions and although we regularly trained to exhaustion it remains my favourite type of training. Many of you will have experienced Steve Symons excellent sessions and the benefits these bring. My favourite session was 12 x 200m in teams of two. We were paired with a runner of equal ability. One runner started half-way along the straight and ran to their partner on the opposite straight. Once you had handed over the recovery was a jog across the track ready for the incoming runner. It was lung bursting because you had to be in position ready for the in-coming runner.</p>\n\n<p>On Sunday mornings the track team trained round Entwistle reservoir between Bolton and Blackburn. These, too, carry great memories. As well as runs around the reservoir we did hill-reps in the forests and reps up the steps of the dam-head embankment. Running on pine needles and their soft cushioning impact remains my favourite ever running surface. The reps up the dam’s head carry different memories – those 147 steps still give me nightmares. Sadly I have barely any photographs of my Bolton days. However, two newspaper cuttings best highlight my memories of being part of a top club.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/dashton2_03.jpg\" alt=\"Bolton Evening News - March 1971\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Bolton Evening News – March 1971</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/dashton2_04.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester Evening News - March 1973\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Manchester Evening News – March 1973</em></p>\n\n<p>Both articles are correct but each has a story behind the report.</p>\n\n<p>The two races cover my best and worst performance for the club. In the medley relay it is true I was overtaken within yards of receiving the baton in first place. What the report doesn’t highlight is the disgust and annoyance I could sense from the Bolton support even whilst running. For the first lap there were token cheers and encouragement. As the race progressed and it was clear I was “sitting-in” on the lead runner those cheers loudened with shouts of “you can do it!”, “use your strength!” and “take him!, take him!”. Remember I’ve already stated races were about achievement of self and club. (How different to the raucous cheers from our lady members who shout encouragement following their race in cross-country races. These cheers are for all standards).</p>\n\n<p>The second report is again factually true but really does carry a story behind it. My services were called upon on the Thursday before Saturday’s race. It was before the days of emails and texts and as we didn’t have a phone at home the message came through from the team manager at work. The race was very important as Bolton needed to finish in the first six to qualify for the National Championships. Our team was considerably weakened by injuries and Ron Hill racing in a marathon in Athens. We travelled as a team on the Friday and stayed overnight at Newcastle University. Once settled in a team meeting was called and the twelve runners were given a race order and a six or three mile leg. I was to run the three mile, sixth leg. An early start Saturday on the short journey to Morpeth to look over the course and further discuss tactics. With the race underway I took over in third place and by the end of my leg I had dropped down to sixth. From this point I was not flavour of the month. (I now appreciate how own goals and penalty misses affect footballers). Luckily everything turned out well and a second place finish was an excellent result for the club.</p>\n\n<p>This is where I went from zero to hero and I got all the plaudits from media coverage because mine made a good story. It is ironic that I got a Northern Counties silver award for this, my poorest race for the club, and a six-pack of lager for my finest in the medley relay. This difference is compounded for someone who doesn’t drink. Needless to say my services were not required for the National Championships.</p>\n\n<p>Reading this I hope I’ve not given the impression that my Bolton career was fraught. It was not and I loved the experience of running at a top club, and knowing I’d achieved my full capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll finish part 2 with an anecdote of how crazy runners can get. In 1971 a small group of Bolton track athletes travelled to a relay meeting in Edinburgh. Nothing unusual here you’ll be thinking. However, the only reason was to say we had run on a tartan track. Nowadays these are common and every park seems to have them. In 1971 there were only two in the country – Crystal Palace and Edinburgh. I’m sure you’ll agree its this “craziness” that makes ours such a great sport to be part of.</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; David Ashton, July 2016</p>",

The pinnacle of my running career.  All downhill from here performance wise but certainly no loss of motivation and enjoyment.\n\nWhy no club vest?  (A hot topic at recent committee meetings).\n\nWhat’s a middle-distance track runner doing running a Category A Long Distance Fell Race?\n\nAnswers below…\n\n## No club vest\n\nAutumn, 1983.  After the two opening fixtures of the cross-country season I left club athletics.\n\nThe reason?\n\nMy mum was suffering terminal cancer and as a family we made the decision to support from home alongside doctor visits and Macmillan nurses.  This together with school sporting commitments meant I could not be relied on for races.  I’ll be honest, too, in saying the motivation for races was not what it had been.\n\nHowever, my love of running did not decrease.  Looking back I believe it was the jogging boom of the early 1980’s which saved me from leaving the sport.  Most athletes called it a day once their peak level of performance had passed.  Yes, there were veteran runners but nothing like the silver-haired, bus-pass class numbers that run and race today.  The jogging boom helped in that I didn’t feel conscious of being out of place when running.\n\nI soon found that running without racing lacked a challenge and more importantly the opportunity to travel and meet people.  As a consequence I joined the Fell Runners Association and ran unattached from 1983 to 2008.\n\n## Fell Racing\n\nI’d had plenty of experience of racing on the fells and although a specialist track runner I found considerable ability in running up hills.  The same was not true on descents and in races I’d count the numbers who overtook me going downhill.  This was particularly apparent in short and medium category A races where the ascent was too steep to run and any advantage I might have had was cancelled out. Through experimenting with different types of fell races I found that my best results came in long distance events.  One event in particular, the Manx Mountain Marathon, fell into this category and a second athletics career opened up.\n\n**If I might offer advice to all you runners it would be to experiment with different distances and terrains and know which gives the best results.**\n\n## The Manx Mountain Marathon\n\nThis race became an obsession and for over 25 years dominated my race programme.  Some years I only did the one race.  Through a series of bullet points I’ll share some of that obsession.\n\n* The race is 31.5m (50km) and has 8000ft. of ascent with 12 summit check points.\n\n* When I talk to non-runners about the event they, firstly, think I’m mad and, secondly, that one has to run up and down 12 mountains.\n\n* This is not the case. Yes. There are steep climbs and descents but there is also a lot of running terrain within the race.\n\n* The event offers magnificent scenery with spectacular views. As well as the obvious mountain terrain there are coastal paths and woodland plantations to add variety.\n\n* On the down side there is a lot of heather and gorse on route and the middle section requires navigational skills.\n\n* Until recently the race took place on Easter Saturday and as a consequence most runners from the mainland made a weekend of the event.\n\n* I became friends with the Clayton Le Moors runners over a number of years. One memory is running with Peter Browning of that club for twenty miles of the race.  Peter is 6ft 4ins and I just about reach 5ft 5ins.  We were both regular runners at the event and got lots of support and encouragement en-route.  We must have looked comical with the height difference and I’m reminded of seeing Peter Crouch lined up alongside Shaun Wright Phillip as substitutes in an England game.\n\n* Training started on January 1st each year and everything was geared to the one event. This consisted of long endurance runs and getting the body used to being out for considerable lengths of time.\n\n* One of the sad obsessions was a strategy I used for getting to sleep at nights. Instead of counting sheep I went over the course in my head weeks before the event.  IT WORKED!\n\n* Quite often we enjoyed a family weekend. Gill always acted as my back-up and was on hand at counter-checkpoints with refreshments and encouragement.  My daughters and son-in-laws also attended and in later years I got cheers from flag waving grandchildren\n\n* Gradually over the years my times got slower. It would be interesting to graph this downward trend as age affected ability.  However, enthusiasm and enjoyment never wavered.\n\n* In 2015 I returned to the race after a 4 year absence. This time my performance nose-dived and I was some 2.5 hours below my best times. (The graph would show a similar reading to the £/$ fall post BREXIT).\n\n* Finally I’ll share my claim to fame regarding this race.  Sadly, it’s not my top ten finishes and age category awards and records.  My claim to fame lies in giving a lesson in how not to cross a mountain stream which was posted on a 2009 YouTube video:\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJE4nvUX9OE?start=272&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n## Bizarre Injury Number Two and My First Real Injury\n\nIn [part 1 of these memories](/david-ashton-a-lifetime-in-athletics-part-1) I recalled the burn to my neck following the finishing tape not being at chest height.  Forty years later I suffered a second head injury.  This time I skidded off a woodland path in freezing weather and … SLAM! I literally head-butted the tree.  Joking apart I was incredibly lucky not to pass out.  The pain was really intense and I gingerly walked the two miles back home.  There was an upside to this injury.  Being a school teacher the sight of me was too scary for children to witness so I had to take some time off work.  These two injuries probably confirm your impressions of me as a TOTAL HEAD-CASE!\n\n![](/content/images/2016/12/dashton3_02.jpg)\n\nI had been incredibly lucky regarding injuries until March, 2012.  On an easy run my knee just gave.  No spectacular fall on a fell-descent just a gentle run in a country park.  I knew instantly it was serious because as well as the severe pain I couldn’t put any weight on my right leg.  Again a hobble back home was required.  The injury was real and threatened any future running.  It has a posh name and took an age to learn the spelling – osteoarthritis.  This means the cartilage has worn and bone is rubbing on bone.  For two years I moaned and groaned and tried to console myself that I’d had 48 years of competitive athletics but, boy, did I miss the harrier scene and the buzz of race days.  Gradually I got back to jogging and after a two year injury returned to racing.  My training now consists of L.S.D. (no, not the American psychedelic drug) but Long Slow Distance a system pioneered in the 1970’s  My knee allows this but will not stand up to intense sessions.  It’s a small price to pay to be back racing.  One final note regarding injuries I’d like to share.  On my first race back following a two year absence the sheer delight and encouragement given by the Manchester YMCA Harriers will stay forever in my memory.\n\n## The Future\n\nIn January 2008 I re-joined the Manchester YMCA Harriers.  There is a record of this by a certain Brian Ashton in the corridor of the Y Club.  Obviously a cloned version of me.  It was a great decision and I just love being part of the club.  How long can I go on?  Who knows?  I’ve certainly no intention of retiring… in fact there’s another landmark age-group category not too far on the horizon.\n\nMy grandchildren Hannah, Sam, and Jessica are all members of Bolton United Harriers.  You can imagine the emotions I experience when I observe them training and racing at a track where I have so many positive memories.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/12/dashton3_03.jpg)\n\nHannah is holding the award for U11 girls team in the Red Rose League and I’ve got the Over-60 team plaque for the South East Lancs League.\n\nWatch out the Brierleys the Ashtons are coming!  Well, perhaps in 10 years or so!\n\nAlmost at the end.  Thank goodness for that did I hear you ask? Oh!\n\nBy the way there will be a test so I know whose read these memoirs.  How will it be marked?  Easy, I’ll observe you staring at my oversized right knee.\n\nFinally, there, promise.\n\n— David Ashton, December 2016",

The person who finishes first in a race receives one point; the second placed finisher gets two points; and so on.\n\nA competitor’s score is simply the sum of their finishing positions. Competitors are ranked by their scores in ascending order; the lower the score, the more highly a competitor is ranked.\n\nScores are only really a consideration once a competitor has qualified for the championship; if a member fails to satisfy the qualifying criteria for a championship, they are excluded from the overall ranking.\n\nAssuming a competitor has qualified for a championship, then their cumulative score consists of their best results that satisfy the qualification criteria. For example, if a competitor must have completed five races in order to qualify for a championship, but they have in fact completed six or more races, then only their best five results will be used to calculate their score – their poorest performances are omitted from the calculation.\n\nIf a member competes in a championship race but then fails to qualify for the championship, all of their performances are excluded from the ranking and if they finished ahead of any other competitors, their scores are adjusted accordingly. For example, if a competitor finished third in a championship race but then fails to satisfy the qualifying criteria, the person who finished in fourth in that race will be moved up to third, fifth place moves up to fourth, and so on.\n\n## The Method in Practice\n\nThe ranking method first considers how close to qualifying each competitor is. Those who have qualified or are closest to qualifying appear at the top of the rankings. A competitor who has qualified will always be above a competitor who is one race away from qualifying, who in turn will be above another competitor who is two races away from qualifying, and so on. A competitor’s score is a secondary consideration until they have qualified.\n\nOnce qualification has been taken into account, competitors are then ranked according to their score. The competitor with the lowest score who has satisfied the qualification criteria will be placed at the top of the rankings.\n\nA slight downside to this method is that positions within the rankings can change markedly at the point when competitors qualify. It is not like a traditional league table, whereby the person with the most (or fewest) points at any one time can be said to be “winning”. A competitor who wins every race they take part in, but who only satisfies the qualifying criteria by completing the last race in the championship will jump from the bottom of the rankings to the top on the completion of that last race.",

            "markdown": "The day had arrived. Sunday 9th October 2005. \n\nVenue: Cardiff. \n\nA cold autumnal day, perfect for a marathon.\n\nThe aim was a PB and hopefully to break 3 hour barrier for the first time.\n\nIt was a fast fairly flat course of 2 large loops going through Cardiff Castle and finishing off in the Millennium Stadium. I was certainly up for it.\n\nIt all seemed to go well for the first 8 miles or so but soon after that I started to feel a pain in my lower back. My stride was shortening; this was not supposed to happen at such an early stage. By 12 miles I had slowed down considerably; a PB was already out of the window.\n\nI had a dilemma: shall I carry on with the second loop and see how far I could go which could lead to a long term injury and I might need to pull out of after 18 miles in \"no-mans land\"? Or, I could change my plans and finish off in the Millennium Stadium, which was looming, having covered about half the distance.\n\nI decided to do the sensible thing for a change; I was not going to come all this way and not finish in the Millennium Stadium! A quick detour was all that was required.\n\nAs I entered the stadium I was greeted with a massive roar from the crowd; there were literally thousands of people inside and I was getting a standing ovation.

Sunday 9th October 2005. </p>\n\n<p>Venue: Cardiff. </p>\n\n<p>A cold autumnal day, perfect for a marathon.</p>\n\n<p>The aim was a PB and hopefully to break 3 hour barrier for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>It was a fast fairly flat course of 2 large loops going through Cardiff Castle and finishing off in the Millennium Stadium. I was certainly up for it.</p>\n\n<p>It all seemed to go well for the first 8 miles or so but soon after that I started to feel a pain in my lower back. My stride was shortening; this was not supposed to happen at such an early stage. By 12 miles I had slowed down considerably; a PB was already out of the window.</p>\n\n<p>I had a dilemma: shall I carry on with the second loop and see how far I could go which could lead to a long term injury and I might need to pull out of after 18 miles in \"no-mans land\"? Or, I could change my plans and finish off in the Millennium Stadium, which was looming, having covered about half the distance.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to do the sensible thing for a change; I was not going to come all this way and not finish in the Millennium Stadium! A quick detour was all that was required.</p>\n\n<p>As I entered the stadium I was greeted with a massive roar from the crowd; there were literally thousands of people inside and I was getting a standing ovation. What a great reception! I naturally carried on with a lap of honor acknowledging the warm support; I did not want it to end now but I crossed the finishing line, activating the chip which was attached to my shoe.</p>\n\n<p>Oh my God!

            "markdown": "What could be better than spending May bank holiday weekend on a three day camping/running adventure in the Lake District? Glorious scenery, convivial company, Spring sunshine, and good coffee. Perfect!\n\nOn Friday 28 April, I woke up early feeling excited and raring to go. The road was unusually quiet for a working morning – no cars, no birds. I opened the curtains and realised why. All I could see was white. There was snow everywhere. Not the gently falling kind either but full on blizzard. I shut the curtains again feeling decidedly less excited.\n\nThe Met Office mountain weather forecast for the Lake District predicted snow, snow and more snow…followed by wind and rain. Next stop the GL3D website, which had clearly not been updated because there was no mention of the event being called off due to the wintry conditions.\n\nI rang Steph, knowing deep down that she was not going to give me the answer I wanted.\n\n“Hi Steph, have you seen the weather outside?”\n\n“Yes, I’ve packed an extra fleece.”\n\n“Oh, OK, I’ll put an extra one in myself.”\n\n“Great, see you later.”\n\nOn the way up the motorway, wedged in the back of Steph and Simon’s car between two large dry bags, a bait box, and a fishing rod, I tried not to pay too much attention to the fact that there was thick snow on the Rossendale hills, on the Bowland hills, on Beacon Fell, on the Pennines, on the Howgills, and on the Lakeland fells. As we drove into the Lakes along the A66 from Penrith, the sky went black and it started sleeting then hailing. Even Steph seemed subdued.\n\nHowever as we drove north towards Bassenthwaite Lake, the weather improved. We drove out of the black cloud into sunshine and there, in front of us, was Skiddaw, shining like white crystal against a clear blue sky. Things were looking up.\n\nThe event centre, in a somewhat surreal departure from the usual rough and ready field, was in the middle of a static caravan park at the north end of Bassenthwaite Lake. Had the weather been warmer, the inhabitants of said caravans would have been able to sit on their little bit of decking on their side of the fence, sipping their gin and tonic whilst watching a bunch of runners pitching tiny one and two man tents, struggling with their tiny stoves and poring over the event map with their tiny head torches in the field on the other side. As it was, the static caravaners were nowhere to be seen. They had obviously read the same weather forecast as I had and stayed at home. \n\nAfter a fine half pint of real ale and fabulous pie and chips at the Sun Inn in Bassenthwaite village, we retired to the campsite. The sun was dropping but the light had not yet all gone. Skiddaw loomed ghostly white above the lake as the last pink rays of sun reflected off the snow. Then suddenly it was dark and cold. Really, really cold. I huddled down in my sleeping bag wearing that extra fleece and crossed my fingers for the morning.\n\nSaturday morning was glorious. Blue skies and sunshine, marred only by the frost on the ground and the ice on the tent. After the obligatory instant porridge for breakfast, Steph and I sorted out our kit, had our dry bags weighed to see if they complied with the 13kg limit (loads of weight to spare – we could have brought that bottle of Prosecco after all) and loaded onto the van. I was a bit worried about Simon. We were leaving him alone for three days with nothing to do but go fishing but he looked remarkably upbeat about the prospect.\n\nWalking boots on, we headed for the bus stop.\nI should perhaps explain at this point that the best bit of the GL3D is the option to choose a course which suits you. There is the Elite course which is frankly for the lunatics. There is the A course, again for the lunatics. There is the B course which is what Steph and I had originally planned on doing when we signed up many months earlier. And then there is the C course, fondly referred to as café class – which is what we ended up doing. In our case, the C stood for crocked. Steph had been hobbling round half marathons and ultra trails for the last year with a knackered Achilles tendon and had finally decided to see sense. I had been struggling with my glutes since the beginning of the year and was not supposed to run for more than 30 minutes every three days. We were in (old) crock class and grateful to be here at all.\n\nThe plan was for those doing the B and C courses to be dropped a little way down the road so that we did not have to run/walk as far as the lunatics. Unfortunately the coaches which the organisers had ordered did not materialise. Instead the bus company sent mini buses. That meant a lot of disgruntled runners hanging about waiting for the bus for an hour or so at the start of the first day. After a wait and a free coffee from the posh coffee van (which is another best bit about the GL3D), we were eventually driven down to Threkeld where we dibbed our dibber and set off on our adventure.\n\nThe first climb was Clough Head. Not my favourite fell but it did not seem as high or as steep as the last time I had been up there and we were bolstered by the fact that the other C course folk headed straight up the front of the fell thus missing and having to re-trace their steps for the first checkpoint, whilst Steph and I trudged round the bottom and climbed up the side, straight to where we needed to be.\n\nThere was a lot of snow so it was hard going along the ridge from Clough Head towards the Dodds, however the snow had been compacted over the past couple of hours by all those GL3D competitors who had got on the earlier buses so that made it a bit easier for us. It was cold but clear and the views across the snow covered fells of the Lake District were spectacular. We were passed by a runner and I commented on the marvellous view. He muttered something about not having time to look at the view and hared off into the distance. I was so glad we were walking not running so we could take the time to enjoy the privilege of being up on the tops on such an amazing day.\n\nWe trudged and slithered along the wide ridge, periodically plunging knee deep into a snow drift. As we neared the first checkpoint on the top of Raise, I had to admire the skill of a skier zig zagging down the slope over to the left of us. And then I had to stop, blink and look again. Why was there a skier zig zagging down the slope over to the left of us? And where had all those snow boarders come from? And was that really a tow lift running up the side of Raise? It turns out that this is the home of the Lake District Ski Club and what we were watching was its members having a bonus Spring day out on the piste!\n\nAfter Raise, it was a short haul up to Helvellyn where again we took a moment to marvel at the winter wonderland spread out before us. Then it was a short hop over Nethermost Pike and up to Dollywaggon Pike, winner of the most charmingly named Lake District fell for the last 10 years running. Alas, the descent from Dollywaggon down to Grisedale Tarn was far from charming. The path was covered with a lethal cocktail of ice and snow drifts so it was slow going, sliding our way down. Eventually we made it to the tarn and from there, down into Grasmere.\n\nHaving spent the day walking in thick snow, freezing temperatures, and increasingly biting wind, arriving in Grasmere was like entering paradise. The sun was out, the air was warm, and the wind had turned into a gentle breeze. The campsite, in a field beyond the village, on the path towards Easedale Tarn, looked like a holiday camp, full of happy campers drinking cold beer in the sunshine. \n\nSteph and I ate our free cake – as good as I remembered it from the last time – and had a nice cup of tea. I had a quick wash in the stream. Then it was up with the blow up tent, on with the camping stove, and soon we were tucking into a hot supper and watching the sun sink towards the skyline above us. \n\nThe weather forecast told us that Sunday would be wet - either drizzle or rain - but, sitting in the sunshine on Saturday evening, no one could quite believe it. The organisers certainly didn’t seem to. They announced that although the forecast was not great, they would not change to the wet weather course. When we woke early on Sunday morning, there was a hopeful 15 minute interlude when we thought that the Lake District had defied the weather forecast yet again. But it was not to be. The first rain drops hammered on the canvas at about 7.30am and it was most certainly not drizzle but full on rain.\n\nIf you go onto the GL3D website and look at the photos of the event, you will see that there are lots of photos of the Saturday, but strangely, not one photo (or even mention) of the Sunday or Monday. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, no one took any photos. There was so much water pouring out of the sky and splashing up from the ground that it would have been like trying to take a photo in a swimming pool. Secondly, the organisers promise that the weather for this event is “usually fine” and they clearly didn’t want to get prosecuted by the advertising standards regulator.\n\nWe packed the wet tent away in one of the “dry” bags and headed out of camp, destination Loweswater. The climb out of Grasmere was steep but straightforward however Grasmere Common had turned into a massive quagmire, and that set the scene for the rest of the day. The snow had all but disappeared, leaving ground which was absolutely sodden even before the rain started to fall. We found ourselves slipping on wet rocks, some of which still had a thin veneer of ice, then wading through swollen streams and sloshing down paths that had turned into streams. By the time we reached Stonethwaite we were cold, wet through, and really quite miserable. There was then a hideous trudge along the road, through Seatoller and up the Honister Pass to the slate mine. The rain kept lashing down and every time a car went past we were sprayed with yet more water. Steph started to gain ground on me and was soon a long way up the road in front of me. By the time I reached the track which made a short cut to the slate mine – and more to the point, the cafe, she was too far ahead on the road to call her back so I took the track thinking that I would meet up with her at the mine. Imagine my horror when I got there and she was nowhere to be seen. I walked back down the road, but no sign of her. I went back to the cafe and had another look around but could not see her. I walked down the road again and back up. This was a nightmare. All I wanted to do was to sit down and have something hot to drink but I had to find Steph. Eventually I realised that my need for a hot drink was more important than my friendship with Steph and I headed into the café to join the queue.\n\n“Where’ve you been? I couldn’t wait any longer so I ordered some soup!”\n\nThere was Steph, sitting in the back corner of the café near the servery with a large bowl of steaming hot soup on the table in front of her. How had I not seen her? Well, I was looking out for someone wearing a distinctive light blue waterproof, and Steph had taken her waterproof off to dry out while she ate her soup.\n\nThe Honister café was without a doubt the highlight of the day. It was crammed full of GL3D participants, warming up and drying out over hot soup, hot pies, hot chocolate – anything hot really. There was even a bunch of runners standing in the entrance to the ladies toilets under an oasis of hot air which was billowing out from the heating system.\n\nAfter our soup, we teamed up with a lovely lady from Stockholm called Kari, whose friend had decided to take the road down to Buttermere rather than going up to the next check point on Fleetwith Pike. I was pretty sure I had been over Fleetwith Pike before although I couldn’t remember much about it. The map showed a straightforward ascent from Honister and then a descent straight down the nose of the fell into Buttermere.\n\n“Does it get this wet in Sweden?” we asked Kari as we headed up the pike.\n\n“It rains a lot, but maybe not this wet.”\n\nWe dibbed in the checkpoint at the top and I pointed out to Kari the main features of the stunning view that she would have seen had we not been in thick mist. On the bright side, looking over the edge as we headed down the path towards Buttermere, we could see so many streams pouring down the side of the fell that it looked like a wide braided river.\n \nThe path turned out to be steep, slippery and exposed. I realised that the reason I had no memory of descending Fleetwith Pike was because my subconscious had blocked it out as unpleasant and unnecessary.\n\n“The last time we came down this path, you said you were never going to do this again.” Steph said unhelpfully as I edged on my bum down a sheer rock face and landed shakily on the grass below.\nIt took us ages to get down. Kari was slow and I was slower, but eventually we made it onto the safety of the tarmac.\n\n“I’m never going to do that again,” I said.\n\nWe headed for the path at the side of Buttermere. Kari thanked us for our company and trotted on ahead and then it was just me and Steph, trudging in the rain along the wooded banks of the lake.\n\nI won’t relate the tedious detail of our walk, along the full length of Buttermere, along part of Crummock Water, taking a path to the left too early and wading through endless bogs to find the path which runs along the back of Melbreak and into Loweswater. We got into camp nine and a half hours after we left Grasmere, tired, footsore, and very, very wet. It turned out that we were one of many people doing the C course that day – even half the lunatic Elite had seen sense and switched to the only course which went past a café! We were also one of only a relatively small number of people who had actually completed the C course by going over Fleetwith Pike.\n\nPutting the tent up in the rain was horrible however we managed to dry out the inside of the tent with the towel which I had packed as a last minute afterthought, and then to keep the tent pretty dry inside. We found a corner of a table in the event marquee to cook our supper. The marquee was turning out to be far too small to accommodate all the people who wanted to stay dry. Those who had bagged a chair and a table space were not moving and those who came in later – the brave/foolhardy people who had done the Elite, A or B courses in spite of the weather, had to stand around clutching their cake and shivering with nowhere to put anything down let alone sit down. The ground in and around the marquee soon turned into a mud bath and no amount of straw thrown onto the ground could soak up the wet mud. Even so, the mood was remarkably cheerful. If an alien newly landed from Mars (or indeed a normal person just arrived from Manchester) had walked into the marquee, they would have thought they had walked into a madhouse - a bunch of nutters surrounded by dripping waterproofs, eating unspeakable re-hydrated food out of bags, chatting away ten to the dozen about the hideous day they had just had, and laughing and joking about the hideous day to come tomorrow, with the sound of pounding rain and howling wind as a backdrop to the jollity.\n\nThings were much less jolly back in our tiny tent. I had picked the wrong side of the tent that night and found that every time a gust of wind hit, the blow up arch came crashing down onto my chest and then bounced back up again once the wind had passed. It did not make for a peaceful night. However in the morning we realised that we were lucky. Lots of people had found that when the wind hit their tent, the poles did not bounce back.\n\nMonday morning and it was still raining, hard. At least there was no need to even try to keep the wet stuff dry as we would be going home at the end of the day. We loaded all the wet stuff into one bag and all the dry stuff into the other bag – guess which was the heavier bag.\n\nThe organisers had finally seen sense and decided to run a shortened course at every level. The C course had lost all its checkpoints. The mission was simply to get to the finish at Whinlatter visitor centre as quickly as possible. Part of me was disappointed not to be going over Grisedale Pike but only a very small part. Mostly I was just relieved. The downside of the revised course was that much of the way from Loweswater to Whinlatter seemed to be on road, however Steph and I identified a couple of footpaths we could take with only a small detour and decided to keep off road as much as we could.\n\nSo it was that about an hour later we found ourselves hopelessly lost in a forestry plantation. We could see where we were supposed to be but there was a barbed wire fence between us and our goal and no matter how far along the fence we went, there was no way through. I admit this was entirely my fault. I did not take a compass bearing or even concentrate on direction as we trudged along, safe in the knowledge that there was only one footpath on the map so we could not possibly go wrong. By the time we got back onto our route, all our fellow competitors, who had gone round the road, had disappeared and we were on our own.\n\nAs we wound our way along a path which skirted the bottom of Whiteside, we noticed that the rain had stopped and the sky was getting brighter. Ten minutes later and the sun came out in a patch of blue sky. Cheered by this unexpected turn in the weather, we had a delightful walk through the forest and arrived at Whinlatter Visitor Centre in good spirits. Unfortunately, we were in the minority. Our fellow C coursers, having taken a more direct route, had arrived while it was still raining and had not yet dried out. They were cold, miserable and right royally pissed off because, as on the first morning, the bus company had sent minibuses rather than coaches to do the pick up so there was a long wait for the lift back to Bassenthwaite. I am afraid I could not feel sorry for them. If they had been just a little more adventurous and got lost in the plantation like Steph and me, they would now be drier, warmer and happier. The person I did feel sorry for was the lady who had missed the announcement about the revised course and had battled over Grisedale Pike in rain and gale force winds.\n\nBack at the event centre Simon was waiting for us, looking tired and dirty but strangely contented. His tent had flooded overnight and all his kit was wet but he did not seem to have noticed. The car was full of empty chocolate wrappers and there was a pike sized smile on his face. We stripped off our waterproofs, ate a last piece of the excellent fruit cake and headed home.\n \nIt was a fabulous weekend all in all – no really it was - and I have no doubt that we will be back. The event itself is a brilliant idea, allowing everyone from the elite runner to the keen walker to challenge themselves in a friendly and supportive environment. I hope that next time the weather will be kinder, the marquee will be bigger, and Steph and I will be fit enough to do the B course. Perhaps this article will tempt some of you to join us?\n\n&mdash; Fiona Hamor\n\n_For information on the Great Lakeland 3Day&trade; and to enter the event, please visit [http://www.greatlakeland3day.com/](http://www.greatlakeland3day.com/)_\n\n_Photo credit: [Ian Corless/Great Lakeland 3Day&trade;](http://www.greatlakeland3day.com/media/photo-galleries/2016-ian-corless-gallery/)_",

Next stop the GL3D website, which had clearly not been updated because there was no mention of the event being called off due to the wintry conditions.</p>\n\n<p>I rang Steph, knowing deep down that she was not going to give me the answer I wanted.</p>\n\n<p>“Hi Steph, have you seen the weather outside?”</p>\n\n<p>“Yes, I’ve packed an extra fleece.”</p>\n\n<p>“Oh, OK, I’ll put an extra one in myself.”</p>\n\n<p>“Great, see you later.”</p>\n\n<p>On the way up the motorway, wedged in the back of Steph and Simon’s car between two large dry bags, a bait box, and a fishing rod, I tried not to pay too much attention to the fact that there was thick snow on the Rossendale hills, on the Bowland hills, on Beacon Fell, on the Pennines, on the Howgills, and on the Lakeland fells. As we drove into the Lakes along the A66 from Penrith, the sky went black and it started sleeting then hailing. Even Steph seemed subdued.</p>\n\n<p>However as we drove north towards Bassenthwaite Lake, the weather improved. We drove out of the black cloud into sunshine and there, in front of us, was Skiddaw, shining like white crystal against a clear blue sky. Things were looking up.</p>\n\n<p>The event centre, in a somewhat surreal departure from the usual rough and ready field, was in the middle of a static caravan park at the north end of Bassenthwaite Lake. Had the weather been warmer, the inhabitants of said caravans would have been able to sit on their little bit of decking on their side of the fence, sipping their gin and tonic whilst watching a bunch of runners pitching tiny one and two man tents, struggling with their tiny stoves and poring over the event map with their tiny head torches in the field on the other side. As it was, the static caravaners were nowhere to be seen. They had obviously read the same weather forecast as I had and stayed at home. </p>\n\n<p>After a fine half pint of real ale and fabulous pie and chips at the Sun Inn in Bassenthwaite village, we retired to the campsite. The sun was dropping but the light had not yet all gone. Skiddaw loomed ghostly white above the lake as the last pink rays of sun reflected off the snow. Then suddenly it was dark and cold. Really, really cold. I huddled down in my sleeping bag wearing that extra fleece and crossed my fingers for the morning.</p>\n\n<p>Saturday morning was glorious. Blue skies and sunshine, marred only by the frost on the ground and the ice on the tent. After the obligatory instant porridge for breakfast, Steph and I sorted out our kit, had our dry bags weighed to see if they complied with the 13kg limit (loads of weight to spare – we could have brought that bottle of Prosecco after all) and loaded onto the van. I was a bit worried about Simon. We were leaving him alone for three days with nothing to do but go fishing but he looked remarkably upbeat about the prospect.</p>\n\n<p>Walking boots on, we headed for the bus stop. <br />\nI should perhaps explain at this point that the best bit of the GL3D is the option to choose a course which suits you. There is the Elite course which is frankly for the lunatics. There is the A course, again for the lunatics. There is the B course which is what Steph and I had originally planned on doing when we signed up many months earlier. And then there is the C course, fondly referred to as café class – which is what we ended up doing. In our case, the C stood for crocked. Steph had been hobbling round half marathons and ultra trails for the last year with a knackered Achilles tendon and had finally decided to see sense. I had been struggling with my glutes since the beginning of the year and was not supposed to run for more than 30 minutes every three days. We were in (old) crock class and grateful to be here at all.</p>\n\n<p>The plan was for those doing the B and C courses to be dropped a little way down the road so that we did not have to run/walk as far as the lunatics. Unfortunately the coaches which the organisers had ordered did not materialise. Instead the bus company sent mini buses. That meant a lot of disgruntled runners hanging about waiting for the bus for an hour or so at the start of the first day. After a wait and a free coffee from the posh coffee van (which is another best bit about the GL3D), we were eventually driven down to Threkeld where we dibbed our dibber and set off on our adventure.</p>\n\n<p>The first climb was Clough Head. Not my favourite fell but it did not seem as high or as steep as the last time I had been up there and we were bolstered by the fact that the other C course folk headed straight up the front of the fell thus missing and having to re-trace their steps for the first checkpoint, whilst Steph and I trudged round the bottom and climbed up the side, straight to where we needed to be.</p>\n\n<p>There was a lot of snow so it was hard going along the ridge from Clough Head towards the Dodds, however the snow had been compacted over the past couple of hours by all those GL3D competitors who had got on the earlier buses so that made it a bit easier for us. It was cold but clear and the views across the snow covered fells of the Lake District were spectacular. We were passed by a runner and I commented on the marvellous view. He muttered something about not having time to look at the view and hared off into the distance. I was so glad we were walking not running so we could take the time to enjoy the privilege of being up on the tops on such an amazing day.</p>\n\n<p>We trudged and slithered along the wide ridge, periodically plunging knee deep into a snow drift. As we neared the first checkpoint on the top of Raise, I had to admire the skill of a skier zig zagging down the slope over to the left of us. And then I had to stop, blink and look again. Why was there a skier zig zagging down the slope over to the left of us? And where had all those snow boarders come from? And was that really a tow lift running up the side of Raise? It turns out that this is the home of the Lake District Ski Club and what we were watching was its members having a bonus Spring day out on the piste!</p>\n\n<p>After Raise, it was a short haul up to Helvellyn where again we took a moment to marvel at the winter wonderland spread out before us. Then it was a short hop over Nethermost Pike and up to Dollywaggon Pike, winner of the most charmingly named Lake District fell for the last 10 years running. Alas, the descent from Dollywaggon down to Grisedale Tarn was far from charming. The path was covered with a lethal cocktail of ice and snow drifts so it was slow going, sliding our way down. Eventually we made it to the tarn and from there, down into Grasmere.</p>\n\n<p>Having spent the day walking in thick snow, freezing temperatures, and increasingly biting wind, arriving in Grasmere was like entering paradise. The sun was out, the air was warm, and the wind had turned into a gentle breeze. The campsite, in a field beyond the village, on the path towards Easedale Tarn, looked like a holiday camp, full of happy campers drinking cold beer in the sunshine. </p>\n\n<p>Steph and I ate our free cake – as good as I remembered it from the last time – and had a nice cup of tea. I had a quick wash in the stream. Then it was up with the blow up tent, on with the camping stove, and soon we were tucking into a hot supper and watching the sun sink towards the skyline above us. </p>\n\n<p>The weather forecast told us that Sunday would be wet - either drizzle or rain - but, sitting in the sunshine on Saturday evening, no one could quite believe it. The organisers certainly didn’t seem to. They announced that although the forecast was not great, they would not change to the wet weather course. When we woke early on Sunday morning, there was a hopeful 15 minute interlude when we thought that the Lake District had defied the weather forecast yet again. But it was not to be. The first rain drops hammered on the canvas at about 7.30am and it was most certainly not drizzle but full on rain.</p>\n\n<p>If you go onto the GL3D website and look at the photos of the event, you will see that there are lots of photos of the Saturday, but strangely, not one photo (or even mention) of the Sunday or Monday. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, no one took any photos. There was so much water pouring out of the sky and splashing up from the ground that it would have been like trying to take a photo in a swimming pool. Secondly, the organisers promise that the weather for this event is “usually fine” and they clearly didn’t want to get prosecuted by the advertising standards regulator.</p>\n\n<p>We packed the wet tent away in one of the “dry” bags and headed out of camp, destination Loweswater. The climb out of Grasmere was steep but straightforward however Grasmere Common had turned into a massive quagmire, and that set the scene for the rest of the day. The snow had all but disappeared, leaving ground which was absolutely sodden even before the rain started to fall. We found ourselves slipping on wet rocks, some of which still had a thin veneer of ice, then wading through swollen streams and sloshing down paths that had turned into streams. By the time we reached Stonethwaite we were cold, wet through, and really quite miserable. There was then a hideous trudge along the road, through Seatoller and up the Honister Pass to the slate mine. The rain kept lashing down and every time a car went past we were sprayed with yet more water. Steph started to gain ground on me and was soon a long way up the road in front of me. By the time I reached the track which made a short cut to the slate mine – and more to the point, the cafe, she was too far ahead on the road to call her back so I took the track thinking that I would meet up with her at the mine. Imagine my horror when I got there and she was nowhere to be seen. I walked back down the road, but no sign of her. I went back to the cafe and had another look around but could not see her. I walked down the road again and back up. This was a nightmare. All I wanted to do was to sit down and have something hot to drink but I had to find Steph. Eventually I realised that my need for a hot drink was more important than my friendship with Steph and I headed into the café to join the queue.</p>\n\n<p>“Where’ve you been? I couldn’t wait any longer so I ordered some soup!”</p>\n\n<p>There was Steph, sitting in the back corner of the café near the servery with a large bowl of steaming hot soup on the table in front of her. How had I not seen her? Well, I was looking out for someone wearing a distinctive light blue waterproof, and Steph had taken her waterproof off to dry out while she ate her soup.</p>\n\n<p>The Honister café was without a doubt the highlight of the day. It was crammed full of GL3D participants, warming up and drying out over hot soup, hot pies, hot chocolate – anything hot really. There was even a bunch of runners standing in the entrance to the ladies toilets under an oasis of hot air which was billowing out from the heating system.</p>\n\n<p>After our soup, we teamed up with a lovely lady from Stockholm called Kari, whose friend had decided to take the road down to Buttermere rather than going up to the next check point on Fleetwith Pike. I was pretty sure I had been over Fleetwith Pike before although I couldn’t remember much about it. The map showed a straightforward ascent from Honister and then a descent straight down the nose of the fell into Buttermere.</p>\n\n<p>“Does it get this wet in Sweden?” we asked Kari as we headed up the pike.</p>\n\n<p>“It rains a lot, but maybe not this wet.”</p>\n\n<p>We dibbed in the checkpoint at the top and I pointed out to Kari the main features of the stunning view that she would have seen had we not been in thick mist. On the bright side, looking over the edge as we headed down the path towards Buttermere, we could see so many streams pouring down the side of the fell that it looked like a wide braided river.</p>\n\n<p>The path turned out to be steep, slippery and exposed. I realised that the reason I had no memory of descending Fleetwith Pike was because my subconscious had blocked it out as unpleasant and unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>“The last time we came down this path, you said you were never going to do this again.” Steph said unhelpfully as I edged on my bum down a sheer rock face and landed shakily on the grass below.\nIt took us ages to get down. Kari was slow and I was slower, but eventually we made it onto the safety of the tarmac.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m never going to do that again,” I said.</p>\n\n<p>We headed for the path at the side of Buttermere. Kari thanked us for our company and trotted on ahead and then it was just me and Steph, trudging in the rain along the wooded banks of the lake.</p>\n\n<p>I won’t relate the tedious detail of our walk, along the full length of Buttermere, along part of Crummock Water, taking a path to the left too early and wading through endless bogs to find the path which runs along the back of Melbreak and into Loweswater. We got into camp nine and a half hours after we left Grasmere, tired, footsore, and very, very wet. It turned out that we were one of many people doing the C course that day – even half the lunatic Elite had seen sense and switched to the only course which went past a café! We were also one of only a relatively small number of people who had actually completed the C course by going over Fleetwith Pike.</p>\n\n<p>Putting the tent up in the rain was horrible however we managed to dry out the inside of the tent with the towel which I had packed as a last minute afterthought, and then to keep the tent pretty dry inside. We found a corner of a table in the event marquee to cook our supper. The marquee was turning out to be far too small to accommodate all the people who wanted to stay dry. Those who had bagged a chair and a table space were not moving and those who came in later – the brave/foolhardy people who had done the Elite, A or B courses in spite of the weather, had to stand around clutching their cake and shivering with nowhere to put anything down let alone sit down. The ground in and around the marquee soon turned into a mud bath and no amount of straw thrown onto the ground could soak up the wet mud. Even so, the mood was remarkably cheerful. If an alien newly landed from Mars (or indeed a normal person just arrived from Manchester) had walked into the marquee, they would have thought they had walked into a madhouse - a bunch of nutters surrounded by dripping waterproofs, eating unspeakable re-hydrated food out of bags, chatting away ten to the dozen about the hideous day they had just had, and laughing and joking about the hideous day to come tomorrow, with the sound of pounding rain and howling wind as a backdrop to the jollity.</p>\n\n<p>Things were much less jolly back in our tiny tent. I had picked the wrong side of the tent that night and found that every time a gust of wind hit, the blow up arch came crashing down onto my chest and then bounced back up again once the wind had passed. It did not make for a peaceful night. However in the morning we realised that we were lucky. Lots of people had found that when the wind hit their tent, the poles did not bounce back.</p>\n\n<p>Monday morning and it was still raining, hard. At least there was no need to even try to keep the wet stuff dry as we would be going home at the end of the day. We loaded all the wet stuff into one bag and all the dry stuff into the other bag – guess which was the heavier bag.</p>\n\n<p>The organisers had finally seen sense and decided to run a shortened course at every level. The C course had lost all its checkpoints. The mission was simply to get to the finish at Whinlatter visitor centre as quickly as possible. Part of me was disappointed not to be going over Grisedale Pike but only a very small part. Mostly I was just relieved. The downside of the revised course was that much of the way from Loweswater to Whinlatter seemed to be on road, however Steph and I identified a couple of footpaths we could take with only a small detour and decided to keep off road as much as we could.</p>\n\n<p>So it was that about an hour later we found ourselves hopelessly lost in a forestry plantation. We could see where we were supposed to be but there was a barbed wire fence between us and our goal and no matter how far along the fence we went, there was no way through. I admit this was entirely my fault. I did not take a compass bearing or even concentrate on direction as we trudged along, safe in the knowledge that there was only one footpath on the map so we could not possibly go wrong. By the time we got back onto our route, all our fellow competitors, who had gone round the road, had disappeared and we were on our own.</p>\n\n<p>As we wound our way along a path which skirted the bottom of Whiteside, we noticed that the rain had stopped and the sky was getting brighter. Ten minutes later and the sun came out in a patch of blue sky. Cheered by this unexpected turn in the weather, we had a delightful walk through the forest and arrived at Whinlatter Visitor Centre in good spirits. Unfortunately, we were in the minority. Our fellow C coursers, having taken a more direct route, had arrived while it was still raining and had not yet dried out. They were cold, miserable and right royally pissed off because, as on the first morning, the bus company had sent minibuses rather than coaches to do the pick up so there was a long wait for the lift back to Bassenthwaite. I am afraid I could not feel sorry for them. If they had been just a little more adventurous and got lost in the plantation like Steph and me, they would now be drier, warmer and happier. The person I did feel sorry for was the lady who had missed the announcement about the revised course and had battled over Grisedale Pike in rain and gale force winds.</p>\n\n<p>Back at the event centre Simon was waiting for us, looking tired and dirty but strangely contented. His tent had flooded overnight and all his kit was wet but he did not seem to have noticed. The car was full of empty chocolate wrappers and there was a pike sized smile on his face. We stripped off our waterproofs, ate a last piece of the excellent fruit cake and headed home.</p>\n\n<p>It was a fabulous weekend all in all – no really it was - and I have no doubt that we will be back. The event itself is a brilliant idea, allowing everyone from the elite runner to the keen walker to challenge themselves in a friendly and supportive environment. I hope that next time the weather will be kinder, the marquee will be bigger, and Steph and I will be fit enough to do the B course. Perhaps this article will tempt some of you to join us?</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; Fiona Hamor</p>\n\n<p><em>For information on the Great Lakeland 3Day&trade; and to enter the event, please visit <a href=\"http://www.greatlakeland3day.com/\">http://www.greatlakeland3day.com/</a></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.greatlakeland3day.com/media/photo-galleries/2016-ian-corless-gallery/\">Ian Corless/Great Lakeland 3Day&trade;</a></em></p>",

For the next couple of months I received numerous texts asking me if I fancied taking part in various hard core events. Each time I felt unable to accept due to lack of training/fitness or working etc. But, when she suggested the White Rose Ultra, I really had no excuse to decline. There was a 30-mile option, the route was fully marked (no navigation required) and there was a generous eight-hour cut-off.\n \nRace day dawned.

The route was a 30-mile loop, two loops for the 60-milers and three loops with a 10-mile out-and-back at the start for the 100-milers.

We didn’t speak much, head down, hoods up but I did ascertain that Number 5 was planning to do the 60-mile option which made me more inclined to help. It wasn’t all one sided, having Number 5 behind me was company and I felt obliged to maintain the pace rather than dawdle. Also, Number 5 had done her homework and had studied the route. She knew what was coming next such as a 3.2-mile climb after the next reservoir and she wore a Garmin, so knew our mileage.\n \nWe completed the loop and after a quick turnaround Number 5 set off to go round again.

This time it was a bottle of Monkey 47, bought for us by some well meaning friends, which did the damage.\n\nMy first glass - botanical heaven on ice with a slosh of tonic and a slice of lime – coincided with the arrival in my inbox of an email from Steph about the Lakes 10 peaks race. “Yeah right” I thought as the gin went down. By the end of my second glass, I was feeling a bit more gung-ho about the prospect of a Lakeland ultra.  Two more G&Ts and an easy online booking later, the deed was done. “Hey, 48K, 3,200 metres of climb.  How hard can it be?  I have plenty of time to train.  Cheers!”\n \nThe next morning I was woken by my partner tapping me on my shoulder.  I could just about make out what he was saying through my hangover. \n\n“I forgot to do something really important last night.” \n\n“What?”\n\n“You said if you ever tried to sign up for another ultra, I was to remind you how awful you felt during the OCC and stop you.”\n\nI swore I would never drink gin again.\n\nI don’t know what happened to all that training I promised myself I would do.  Steph was in fine form but I was bricking it as we registered at Keswick Rugby Club on the evening of 23 June and were issued with a map, dibber, GPS tracker and a race T shirt (extra small so it fitted me for a change, but grey? Really?).\n\nAt 4.30am the next morning we were delivered to Swirl How car park by the event coaches.  It was cold and yet the midges were out.  The marshals, equipped with netting head covers, were on good form. All the runners could do was to bounce up and down, scratching and slapping away the bloodthirsty little blighters.  Whether I was still in shock from getting up so early in the morning, or because I knew that my pack was filled with enough mint cake to rebuild Kendal, I felt much more chipper than I had the night before. Ten peaks? Bring it on!\n\n5am and we were off, up the first of the ten – Helvellyn. The sun was already up but there was still a pink gold tinge in the sky which made the morning seem magical. 6am on the top of Helvellyn and I felt like the luckiest person alive. The view of the Scafell range across the valley was spectacular (in fact that would be the only time we saw the Scafell range that day) although we didn’t hang about to enjoy it for more than a couple of seconds as the first cut off deadline spurred us on over the ridge and back down to the road at Steel End. We managed to take a wrong turn near the bottom but it turned out OK as we found a nice broad forest track which zig zagged us down (eventually) to where we were supposed to be.\n\n“Happy with your choice of route?” asked the marshal as we approached the checkpoint from the wrong direction. \n\n“Absolutely” I said with as much dignity as I could muster.\n\nHaving reached the checkpoint a good hour before the cut off we knew we could take the foot off the gas a bit however the next section of the route – a path rising gently up the valley following the course of the Wyth Burn towards High Raise - looked eminently runnable on the map so we scurried off hoping to make good time. Alas on the ground it was a very different story. The path started out a bit wet and muddy and before long became a bog and then a series of swamps.  As Steph and I edged cautiously around the evil looking swamps, a number of people in front of us obviously thought they could adopt the approach you would take in a local fell race of running straight through. They soon realised this was a big mistake as shoes and limbs disappeared without trace.\n \nAs we climbed up the path, we came upon two men without any trousers on. It was a bit early in the morning for that sort of excitement so I was minded to ignore them and keep going, but Steph insisted on stopping to ask why they were undressing in the middle of the path. They explained they had fallen into one of the swamps up to the chest and so were changing out of their wet and evil smelling running kit into their waterproofs for the rest of the day.  It also turned out they did not know each other but spent the rest of the day together having bonded as a result of the hideous experience they had shared.\n \nWe left the bog men to finish their toilette and continued up the path to High Raise (peak number 2) and then on to Angle Tarn. The weather had come in and above us, Bowfell and its neighbouring peaks were shrouded in a thick clag. As we started the steep climb up to Ore Gap I remember looking down at my hands and thinking that I would not be able to see much else for the foreseeable future.\n\nBowfell is my favourite peak in the Lakes because you can see the whole of the national park around you. On this occasion however it was nothing more than a pile of rocks jutting out of the mist and peak three of ten. Esk Pike followed and then Great End and Ill Crag. They all seemed horribly similar.  The wind was gusting now, the sky was full of drizzle and we could see nothing but mist (and my hands). I was aware that we were going really slowly but it was impossible to move quickly as the rocks were treacherously slippery.\n\nWe bumped into the bog men again as we came down off Ill Crag. They were in much better spirits now and were making good progress thanks to a rather nifty GPS watch belonging to the younger of the two. He seemed to be having more luck with his GPS than I was with my iPhone app. At that moment, we were approached by a group of three runners who were relying on map and compass. Having swapped devices, we realised that we were all lost. \n\n“We need to stick with him” I said, pointing to the younger bog man. “His GPS is better than mine!”\n\nSo we all teamed up and followed GPS man (re-named in honour of his watch) through the mist.\n\nAnd now, a word of advice. Never blindly follow a man you have never met before in the mist, even if he is wearing a bright yellow waterproof and sporting a fancy watch! GPS man led us along a path (in the loosest sense of the word) which went underneath Broad Crag rather than to its summit. By the time we realised we had gone wrong (again), we had spent so much time negotiating the slippery rocks that we were loath to go back. One of our party headed off into the mist and soon came back to say that he had found a chimney we could scramble up which led directly to the summit.  Everyone decided this was a good idea and headed off to climb up the rocky face of Broad Crag. I am terrified of scrambling up wet slippery rock, particularly when I can’t see what is coming next, but there was no option so I started to climb behind the others, feeling very shaky. I soon got stuck because my legs would not reach far enough and I started to panic. Then a hand came down out of the mist to pull me up, and a voice told me not to worry, to take it easy, and talked me up the climb. \n\nI cannot thank the lovely man from Eskdale enough for his kindness and support on Broad Crag. I am not sure I would have made it without him.\n\nFrom Broad Crag it was a short sharp pull up to the top of Scafell Pike, which was busier than Piccadilly station at rush hour notwithstanding the evil weather. We had done seven peaks and I felt that if we could only get down to Styhead, the worst would be over.\n\nIt was such a relief to come down out of the mist as we approached Styhead tarn. The world was still there in glorious technicolour and we allowed ourselves a quick breather and a look around before we headed up Great Gable and back into the mist again. We met a lovely young man on Great Gable who was doing the long route (did I mention there was a long route, presumably for people who had drunk even more gin than I had?) and who showed us a cunning route off the side to avoid the worst of the scree down to Windy Gap. From there it was a lovely run down to Honister Pass and the next check point, where I was looking forward to (nay hallucinating about) a large piece of Wilf’s fruit cake.\n\nIt seemed we were the only runners who had not dropped a bag with a dry pair of shoes at the check point. \n\n“You’re very hardy” a marshal commented.\n\n“I only have the one pair” I pointed out, “I’m not hardy, just hard up.”\n\nThere were sandwiches, soup and cake at the checkpoint. We filled our water bottles and sorted out our kit, I drank a cup of soup and Steph ate some cake, then we set off again. There was only one more peak to go but that peak was Dale Head – a tedious pull with one false summit after another.  Halfway up the climb I realised that I had left my cake on the table at the checkpoint.\n\n“You could always go back for it” Steph offered helpfully.\n\nComing off Dale Head, we felt almost euphoric but perhaps that was because we almost flew off the summit, so strong was the wind by this stage.  There was a long steep descent past a spectacular waterfall.  We then picked up a lovely windy path down the Newlands valley which led in turn down to a landrover track which took us out of the valley to the road at the foot of Catbells. From there it was an easy run to the last checkpoint at Nichol End and then into Keswick. There was a moment of confusion as we ran into the field next to the rugby club and Steph kept on running, past the rugby club towards an open air concert which was being staged at the other end of the park. \n\n“Stop” I yelled but my mouth was dry and nothing came out, and I had no hope of catching her. One of the marshals went after her and directed her to the finish.\n\nWe were out for 15 hours and 15 minutes give or take. I was mortified at how slow we had been until I realised that out of 104 starters on the short course, only 84 finished and we came in at 40 and 41 overall, and 7th and 8th ladies. It was a great day out and never has a cup of coffee tasted better than the flat white I had from Joey’s van at the end of the race, but please, next time I drink too much gin and try to sign up for another ultra will someone remind me how awful I felt for much of the day and tell me not to!\n\n&mdash; Fiona Hamor\n\n_For more information on the 10 Peaks races and to enter next year's races, visit http://www.10peaks.com/_",

Having swapped devices, we realised that we were all lost. </p>\n\n<p>“We need to stick with him” I said, pointing to the younger bog man. “His GPS is better than mine!”</p>\n\n<p>So we all teamed up and followed GPS man (re-named in honour of his watch) through the mist.</p>\n\n<p>And now, a word of advice. Never blindly follow a man you have never met before in the mist, even if he is wearing a bright yellow waterproof and sporting a fancy watch! GPS man led us along a path (in the loosest sense of the word) which went underneath Broad Crag rather than to its summit. By the time we realised we had gone wrong (again), we had spent so much time negotiating the slippery rocks that we were loath to go back. One of our party headed off into the mist and soon came back to say that he had found a chimney we could scramble up which led directly to the summit.  Everyone decided this was a good idea and headed off to climb up the rocky face of Broad Crag. I am terrified of scrambling up wet slippery rock, particularly when I can’t see what is coming next, but there was no option so I started to climb behind the others, feeling very shaky. I soon got stuck because my legs would not reach far enough and I started to panic. Then a hand came down out of the mist to pull me up, and a voice told me not to worry, to take it easy, and talked me up the climb. </p>\n\n<p>I cannot thank the lovely man from Eskdale enough for his kindness and support on Broad Crag. I am not sure I would have made it without him.</p>\n\n<p>From Broad Crag it was a short sharp pull up to the top of Scafell Pike, which was busier than Piccadilly station at rush hour notwithstanding the evil weather. We had done seven peaks and I felt that if we could only get down to Styhead, the worst would be over.</p>\n\n<p>It was such a relief to come down out of the mist as we approached Styhead tarn. The world was still there in glorious technicolour and we allowed ourselves a quick breather and a look around before we headed up Great Gable and back into the mist again. We met a lovely young man on Great Gable who was doing the long route (did I mention there was a long route, presumably for people who had drunk even more gin than I had?) and who showed us a cunning route off the side to avoid the worst of the scree down to Windy Gap. From there it was a lovely run down to Honister Pass and the next check point, where I was looking forward to (nay hallucinating about) a large piece of Wilf’s fruit cake.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed we were the only runners who had not dropped a bag with a dry pair of shoes at the check point. </p>\n\n<p>“You’re very hardy” a marshal commented.</p>\n\n<p>“I only have the one pair” I pointed out, “I’m not hardy, just hard up.”</p>\n\n<p>There were sandwiches, soup and cake at the checkpoint. We filled our water bottles and sorted out our kit, I drank a cup of soup and Steph ate some cake, then we set off again. There was only one more peak to go but that peak was Dale Head – a tedious pull with one false summit after another.  Halfway up the climb I realised that I had left my cake on the table at the checkpoint.</p>\n\n<p>“You could always go back for it” Steph offered helpfully.</p>\n\n<p>Coming off Dale Head, we felt almost euphoric but perhaps that was because we almost flew off the summit, so strong was the wind by this stage.  There was a long steep descent past a spectacular waterfall.  We then picked up a lovely windy path down the Newlands valley which led in turn down to a landrover track which took us out of the valley to the road at the foot of Catbells. From there it was an easy run to the last checkpoint at Nichol End and then into Keswick. There was a moment of confusion as we ran into the field next to the rugby club and Steph kept on running, past the rugby club towards an open air concert which was being staged at the other end of the park. </p>\n\n<p>“Stop” I yelled but my mouth was dry and nothing came out, and I had no hope of catching her. One of the marshals went after her and directed her to the finish.</p>\n\n<p>We were out for 15 hours and 15 minutes give or take. I was mortified at how slow we had been until I realised that out of 104 starters on the short course, only 84 finished and we came in at 40 and 41 overall, and 7th and 8th ladies. It was a great day out and never has a cup of coffee tasted better than the flat white I had from Joey’s van at the end of the race, but please, next time I drink too much gin and try to sign up for another ultra will someone remind me how awful I felt for much of the day and tell me not to!</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; Fiona Hamor</p>\n\n<p><em>For more information on the 10 Peaks races and to enter next year's races, visit <a href=\"http://www.10peaks.com/\">http://www.10peaks.com/</a></em></p>",

            "markdown": "Having never been to the Isle of Man before and having always wanted to, I was a sucker for Steph Goodchild’s suggestion of doing the Manx Mountain Marathon.  Hey - I’ve done marathons before - it's not so bad and anyway, there aren’t any mountains on the Isle of Man are there? Well, none I’ve heard of so they can’t be that big. It's true to say that on 8th July 2017 I was put to rights on this score.\n\nThe race is actually 50 kilometres (30.5 miles but we ended up doing 32 somehow) and there is only one true mountain - Snaefell - but during the race you go up and down quite a few hills which can’t be far off qualifying. There was however a half marathon for those without 9 hours to spare. Four of us were competing, three Harriers - David Ashton, Steph Goodchild, Steve Symons and an interloper - me! \n\nThe race involved navigation (yeek!) and you needed to have a good idea where you were going as there were only 66 entrants with fewer starting and these fairly quickly got spaced out. Luckily David Ashton had completed the course many times so he knew the way. Unluckily I wasn’t good enough to keep up with him!\n\nThe weather was fine as we set off from Ramsey in the north of the island, headed for Port Erin in the south of the island via pretty much every hill they've got. After some deceptively easy road running we began to climb the first hill - South Barrule. At each hilltop (10 of them) we had to clip a waterproof piece of paper which we were given to prove we’d actually been there. At the end I was very disappointed no one checked mine… I could have shaved another 1 minute 30 seconds off my time if I hadn’t stopped to clip! Many of these hills have unusual and enchanting names - Slieau Ruy, Cronk Ny Arrey Laa and Greeba.\n\nWith clear weather there were excellent views especially from the top of Snaefell but the weather got a little too hot later and for the first time in my life I got sunburnt whilst carrying a waterproof jacket and trousers. The terrain was extremely varied from roads to paths and sometimes just across country through heather and more painfully gorse which perforated our legs.\n\nAfter about 18 miles we turned a corner to be confronted with a large crowd of runners. We quickly realised that this was the start of the half marathon. The man with the tannoy announced to the crowd that we were doing the ultra and the whole throng clapped and cheered us. It was a moment to savour but not for too long as a couple of minutes later the whole lot of them charged past us when their race started.\n\nAfter all the hills had been scaled the end of the race was gentler with nice soft grass to run on for my aching knees and at the finish at Port Erin there was a free bottle of beer for all finishers as well as a technical tee shirt and best of all a choc ice - definitely the best post race treat.\n\nThanks must go to Lisa and Simon who flitted from one place to another to intercept us with drinks and sweets which was much appreciated as the heat made extra drinks stations essential.\n\n&mdash; Dave Jones",

There is another car park off the A576 Middleton Road, which is about a 10-minute walk away from the start/finish, and another car park off the A6044 Sheepfoot Lane, which is about a 15-minute walk from the start/finish.\n\n### By tram\nThe nearest tram stop is [Heaton Park](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/heaton-park-tram), which is on Bury Old Road. If you're traveling from Manchester city centre, catch the Bury service.\n\nIt is a 10-15 minute walk to the start/finish area. From the tram stop, cross the road and enter the park through the gates, then head straight until you come to a T-junction.  Turn left here - the start/finish area is at the top of the hill on the right-hand side.\n\n### By bus\n[The nearest bus stop is next to the tram stop on Bury Old Road](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/stops/1800NC41741/135).  The 135 runs regularly from Piccadilly Gardens.\n\n## More information\nMore information for the race is available from the [Manchester Area Cross Country League website](http://maccl.co.uk/heaton-park/).\n\n[It is also worth following the Manchester Area Cross Country League on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ManAreaXC).",

Otherwise, you can collect you race number from a member of the committee before the race.\n\n**Remember to keep your race number safe - you will need the same number for all Manchester Area League events this winter!**\n\n## No entries on the day\nThe Manchester Area League are no longer accepting entries on the day of the event - if you haven't signed up for our cross country championships this year but want to take part, please [get in touch](/contact)!\n\n## Travel\n\n### By car\nThere is plenty of car parking at the venue, however **please do not park on the narrow access road**.\n\nThe best postcode to use for \"Sat Navs\" is **M23 0BD**, however be careful to access the venue using the route described below through Northern Moor - **don't use the bus lane off Princess Parkway.** _(Having done this once in his youth, your correspondent was once pulled over for a chat with a police officer!)_\n\nFrom the M60, leave at junction 5 and join the A5103 (Princess Parkway) southbound (signs to Wythenshawe). Immediately leave the A5103 to join the B5167. On leaving turn right (this will take you under the A5103) onto the B5167 (Wythenshawe Road).\n\nTo get to the sports ground from Wythenshawe Road (B5167) turn left/right coming from the west/east (if you have just left the A5103 it’s a right turn) onto Sale Road (B5166). Take a right off Sale Road onto Yewtree Lane and then left onto Willenhall Road. Continue along Willenhall Road under the motorway. Negotiate a sharp left turn after the motorway underpass and continue along the road to reach the parking area and pavilion.\n\n### By tram\nThe nearest tram stop is [Northern Moor](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/northern-moor-tram). If you're traveling from Manchester city centre, get to [Deansgate-Castlefield](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/deansgate-castlefield-tram) and then board a Manchester Airport service.\n\nIt is about a 15 minute walk to the start/finish area. From the tram stop, head back to Sale Road, cross over and then turn right, heading east. Turn left up Fellpark Road (fourth turn on the left - the road splits around a small semi-circular green), then head to the end of Fellpark Road. Cross over the motorway on the footbridge, then turn right to get to the start area.\n\n### By bus\n[The nearest bus stop is on Sale Road/Orton Road](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/stops/1800SB47511/41).  The [41](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/routes/41-manchester) runs regularly from [Piccadilly Gardens](https://www.tfgm.com/public-transport/bus/stations/manchester-piccadilly-gardens-bus/41).\n\nIt is about a 10 minute walk to the start/finish area. From the bus stop, cross over and continue along Sale Road and take the first right up Fellpark Road. Head to the end of Fellpark Road.

Conditions were perfect for running; we had twelve marathoners taking part, with eight achieving personal best times and five bettering the \"Boston qualifying\" standard!\n\n![Running as a team](/content/images/2018/04/hannah-sarah-heather.jpeg)\n\nIt was great to see so many of our runners working together to achieve their times on the day, bringing months of hard training to a fantastic conclusion!\n\nThe crowds at Manchester were also fantastic - everyone out on the course was super supportive and the ready availability of Jelly Babies probably shaved a good few minutes off our times!\n\n# Who was running?\n\n## Craig Jones - 2:40:31 (PB, BQ, UK Championship)\n![Craig on the way to a massive PB at Manchester](/content/images/2018/04/craig.jpeg)\n\nCraig has worked hard for years to go under 2:45, but he has been frustrated by hot and humid conditions at the Paris, Budapest, Boston and Chicago marathons. Manchester finally provided Craig with the opportunity to run the kind of time that we all knew he could... and **boy did he deliver!**\n\nCraig knocked over nine minutes off his previous personal best to come home in 41st place in the awesome time of **2:40:31**, which will qualify Craig for Championship entry into the London Marathon.\n\nWell done, Craig! You've really earned this one - we're all made up for you!\n\n* [Craig's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134464)\n\n## Mark Griffiths - 3:09:08\n![Mark back on form](/content/images/2018/04/mark.jpeg)\n\nMark hasn't been able to dedicate as much time to his marathon training as he has in the past (see below!), but it hasn't stopped him putting in a typically strong performance here, along with the now traditional \"negative split\" to get home in **3:09:08**.  Mark's fastest mile was the last one... perhaps it was no coincidence with Nicola and Ben there to cheer him home!\n\n* [Mark's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134463)\n\n## Josh Makin - 3:11:11 (PB)\n![Josh can't believe it!](/content/images/2018/04/josh.jpeg)\n\nJosh joined the club a six months ago after making a move up the M62 and his running has gone from strength-to-strength! Josh has followed up a big PB in last October's half-marathon with a monster PB in the marathon... Josh's time of **3:11:11** is a mere hour and ten minutes faster than his previous best!\n\nAwesome work, Josh!\n\n* [Josh's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-138322)\n\n## Martin Rimmer - 3:15:02 (PB)\n## Joseph Hayes - 3:22:52 (PB)\n![Joe and Martin working as a team](/content/images/2018/04/joe-and-martin.jpeg)\n\nMartin and Joseph both joined the club back in October after hearing about us at parkrun and coming along to our [New Runners Night](https://www.manyharrier.co.uk/new-runners-night-thank-you).  Martin, Joseph and Josh have all been training together and putting in a lot of miles in preparation for the Manchester Marathon - and that hard work has paid off with some cracking times! Martin was able to stick with the pacer to come home in **3:15:02**; Joseph started to struggle in the last few miles of the race, but toughed it out to make it back in **3:22:52**.  Two phenomenal performances for a marathon debut!\n\n* [Martin's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134469)\n* [Joseph's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134472)\n\n## Chris March - 3:17:00\n![Chris did much better than expected](/content/images/2018/04/chris.jpeg)\n\nChris has been struggling of late with injury, illness and snow; with little training under his belt, he came into this race with firm expectations of a \"personal worst\". Happily, it all went rather well on the day, with a time of **3:17:00** - more than five minutes ahead of being a \"PW\"!\n\n* [Chris' race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134465)\n\n## Anne Williams - 3:29:49 (BQ)\n![Anne was too fast for our photographers!](/content/images/2018/04/anne.jpeg)\n\nAnne joined us last year after seeing us in action at our [track training sessions](https://www.manyharrier.co.uk/speedwork-sessions). Anne held on to Hannah, Sarah and Heather throughout the race to record a cracking time of **3:29:49** - coming home as the 13th V45 female and some 25 minutes inside the Boston qualifying standard for her age! In fact, she was too fast for our supporters to get a good photo! (Sorry Anne!)\n\n* [Anne's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134471)\n\n## Hannah Brierley - 3:29:56 (PB, BQ)\n![Hannah's Manchester PB is restored](/content/images/2018/04/hannah.jpeg)\n\nAfter missing out on doing a marathon last year due to injury, Hannah came back determined to record an _official_ personal best time at Manchester after having had her 2015 efforts ruled out for being on a slightly short course.  Everything went to plan - **3:29:56** is Hannah's new _official_ PB, and five minutes ahead of the Boston qualifying time too!\n\nGreat stuff, Hannah!\n\n* [Hannah's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134470)\n\n## Sarah Crandon - 3:30:06 (PB, BQ)\n## Heather Hughes - 3:33:10 (PB, BQ)\n![Heather and Sarah looking great coming up to the halfway point](/content/images/2018/04/heather-and-sarah.jpeg)\n\nSarah has been training hard this year for Manchester with the aim of getting 3:30 and her [second Boston qualifying time](http://crandonruns.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/bqing-at-london-marathon-2017.html). Sarah had an injury scare a few weeks before the race, but it all went swimmingly on the day: **3:30:06**, a PB by over four minutes and well inside the Boston qualifying threshold!  Fantastic, Sarah!\n\nHeather put in a cracking performance to stick with Anne, Hannah and Sarah for most of the race, despite it being her first ever road marathon! Heather finished in a Boston-qualifying time of **3:33:10** - not bad for a first attempt!\n\n* [Sarah's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134468)\n* [Heather's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134467)\n\n## Peter Flew - 3:44:39\n![Peter looking a lot more cheerful at mile 25 compared with mile 12](/content/images/2018/04/peter.jpeg)\n\nUnfortunately, unlike most of our other runners at Manchester, Peter's race didn't go to plan.  Having set off with the ambition of going under 3:00, the wheels came off around mile 12 and Peter was at the point of pulling out. Having been given a pep talk from partner Giorgio, Peter and battled through the remaining 14 miles to record a very respectable time of **3:44:39**.\n\n* [Peter's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-136360)\n\n## Jenny Gorman - 3:59:25 (PB)\n![Jenny running to raise money for the Christie](/content/images/2018/04/jenny.jpeg)\n\nJenny ran the Manchester Marathon along with her sister Ruth to raise money for The Christie Hospital. In her first ever marathon, Jenny ducked under the four-hour mark to get home in **3:59:25** - great work!\n\nYou can support The Christie Hospital by [sponsoring Jenny and Ruth on their JustGiving page](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/jenny-gorman).\n\n* [Jenny's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-134466)\n* [Ruth's race result](http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?uid=38-1865-1-138087)\n\n# Who was supporting?\n\nWe had some fantastic support out on the course!\n\n![Emma, Jen, Richard and Nicola (and Moley)](/content/images/2018/04/supporters.jpeg)\n\nEmma, Jen, Richard and Nicola were on hand at the start of the finishing straight to roar us all up towards the finishing line...\n\n![Ben](/content/images/2018/04/ben.jpeg)\n\n... along with young Ben, keeping an eagle-eye out for his dad, Mark!\n\nWe had Neil and Christine out at Dane Road, Richard at Brooklands, Tony and Gail in Timperley (chasing people on their bikes!), Steph and Simon where it starts to get tough at mile 19, Zulma in no man's land at mile 21, Emma at Stretford, Jane on the finishing straight... brilliant!  Thanks so much for your support! (And sorry if I've missed anyone!)\n\nThanks also to all friends and family out supporting; particular mention goes to Ron, Viv, Paul, Clare and all the Jones clan, who were out in numbers to cheer their boy home to his stunning PB (and then to celebrate late into the night afterwards)!\n\n# Family Mile\n![Famke after running the Family Mile](/content/images/2018/04/famke.jpeg)\n\nA special mention must go to Zulma's daughter Famke, just five years old, who clocked 12 minutes in the Family Mile - an amazing time!  One for the future, here...!\n\n# Great day, great attitude!\n\nFinally, I just wanted to share this message we received from Tom who runs with the Manchester Frontrunners:\n\n![Tom's message of thanks](/content/images/2018/04/facebook.jpeg)\n\nWhat an awesome day!\n\nWell done, everyone!",

            "markdown": "When in Copenhagen… go running!\n\nIn May, 13 harriers travelled to Copenhagen to run and watch the marathon.\n\nPlans began last year when Kev and I worked out the Copenhagen marathon would be on his 30th birthday this year.  We were wrong, it ended up being the week before but happily that didn't stop us!\n\nWe had a great mixed group of runners and supporters.  The runners were: Hannah Brierley, Kev Foster, Richard Brierley, Chris March, Emma Elmerhebi, Craig Jones, Zulma Edmondson.  We were also joined by a few non-harriers: Richard Wyers (Chorlton Runners), Paul 'Kermit' Murphy (unattached) and Andrew Brierley (unattached).\n\n![Our runners at Copenhagen Marathon](/content/images/2018/06/2018copenhagenrunners.jpeg)\n\nProviding the support team were Jen Delaney, Jill Guthrie, Gail Brierley, Tony Brierley, Sarah Donohoe and Jonny Lavery along with Andy's partner, Katharine, Richard W's partner Simon and Kev's family, Tony, Pauline and Nicola.\n\n![Nicola, Jen, Simon and Katharine - some of our supporters at the Copenhagen Marathon](/content/images/2018/06/2018copenhagensupport.jpeg)\n\nSunday 13th May dawned bright and warm... **VERY WARM!**  As we made our way to the start we knew it was going to be a tough, hot race.  Some of us were not well prepared.  A few had run good times at Manchester and partied a little too hard since, others had been blighted with injury or training had been derailed.\n\nThe course is a figure of 8 with the runners doing one of the loops twice.  Although this means you have to repeat some of the course but the advantage is it keeps the race very central.  Unlike a lot of marathons where you find yourself running through deserted industrial estates the whole of the race was within the central Copenhagen area.  It's also excellent for spectators who can move around to lots of crossing points and see your runners a number of times.\n\nHaving got a PB at the Manchester marathon and done nothing but booze since, I planned to run the race conservatively and try to enjoy it. (Is there such a thing as enjoying a marathon?)  Andy and I decided to stick together and resolved to set out at 3.35 pace.\n\nWithin 8 miles it was obvious we were not going to maintain that pace and we eased off, trying to run comfortably and enjoying the support from our fabulous friends and the people of Copenhagen.  Great weather and central location meant lots of support.\n\nAt 14 miles Andy started to slow down.  I eased off to stay with him and we were rewarded with seeing Mum and Dad a couple of miles later.  After we passed Mum and Dad I heard them cheering for Zulma so I knew she wasn't far behind.  Sure enough, just after 16 miles Zulma passed us.  She called to me it was feeling easy and I replied she was doing it right then!\n\nWe then hit the party bridge (I don't know what it's actually called) which was **MEGA**!  Flares, people cheering, loud music – it was mental.  Apparently, we are assured by Craig, Rick, Andrew and Katharine who stayed nearby, this is a famous bridge in Copenhagen where there is always a party.  We weren't convinced when they took us back and we were just the sad Brits drinking tins, alone, on a bridge.  But I can confirm the party was there during the marathon!\n\nAt 20 miles we hit the Faelledparken for the second time.   Despite throwing a cup of water over myself at every water stop, I felt hot, horrible and exhausted.  Everyone in the park looked like they were having an amazing time drinking, eating ice creams and enjoying the sun and I just wanted to join them.  I stopped to walk at the next water stop and ushered Andy on his way as I didn't want to hold him back.\n\n![Andy and Hannah in the Copenhagen Marathon](/content/images/2018/06/2018copenhagenhannah2.jpeg)\n\nThe next few miles were tough; I stopped and walked at each water stop grabbing as many orange segments as I could along the way (love this about European marathons, why don't they do this at home?) but just before 24 miles I started to feel better.  I knew I'd cracked it, I would get back.  Shortly after, I caught up with Andy who had hit the wall.  I thought about staying with him but I couldn't - sorry bro, I just had to get to the end at that point!\n\nThe last mile we crossed over the river and suddenly I was met by a wall of cheering people willing all the runners to the finish line.  I made it in 3:45:02.  A couple of minutes later Kermit arrived.  He had set out at a really good pace but a knee injury got to him at the end.  Andy crossed the line a few minutes later.\n\nAll in all, we had some good performance in some very tough conditions.   Craig bagged another sub 2:50 making it look easy as always, Rick sneaked under 3:10, Kev and Chris supported each other to 3:20, Emma battled through to 4:25 and Richard W completed his first ever marathon in 5:15:57.\n\nA special mention has to go to Zulma who absolutely smashed it.  She has trained really hard and consistently and was rewarded on the day with an amazing first marathon time of 3:39:05.  Not only a first marathon but also a Boston Qualifier – surely a shoe-in for the Benidorm trophy next year?\n\n![Zulma making marathon running look easy!](/content/images/2018/06/2018copenhagenzulma.jpeg)\n\nWe were greeted at the finish with beer and snacks from our supporters and spent the next few hours enjoying the sun, the atmosphere and the well-deserved beers.  In true Harriers style, we partied hard that evening... but the less said about that the better!\n\n![Copenhagen after party](/content/images/2018/06/2018copenhagenapresrun.jpeg)\n\nAll in all, a fab weekend in a brilliant city.  If anyone wants to go back, Jonny is threatening to move there or at least do the marathon next year.\n\nWe're thinking about our next adventure, if you've got any suggestions – [just let us know](/contact)!\n\n&mdash; Hannah Brierley",

It involves over 40 miles of running/walking/crawling, 15,750 feet of ascent/descent and four open water swims. The start and finish is at Moot Hall in Keswick, a tourist information office for normal folk and a holy shrine for fell runners. The Frog Graham can be done unsupported or, if you prefer, you can bring your friends.\n \nSupporting cast in order of appearance:\n \n* David Jones\n* Stephen Hindmarsh\n* Julie Laverock\n* Neil Woods\n* Matt Slack\n* Fiona Hamor\n \nIt was my boss Neil who told me about the Frog Graham and I was captured by the idea of the journey through the north western area of the Lake District. All I needed to do was get a good team together to help me on my way. The date was chosen based on daylight hours and a full moon.\n \n## Leg 1: Moot Hall to Bassenthwaite Church via Skiddaw\n\n![Steph outside Moot Hall in Keswick](/content/images/2018/08/01_start.jpg)\n\n01:55, Moot Hall Keswick – all set to go: trail shoes, shorts, t-shirt, rucksack and head torch – a local drunk shuffled towards me.\n\n“Going for a run” he asked. \n\n“Doing the Frog Graham” I replied. \n\n“The f\\*\\*\\*ing Frog Graham!” he exclaimed. \n\n“The f\\*\\*\\*ing Frog Graham” I confirmed.\n\nHe hugged me and shuffled away muttering something about fell running nutters. \n\n2am and we were off. David ran with me for the first half hour and then headed off to pick up Stephen and meet me on the other side of Skiddaw.\n\nI was alone. It was dark, quiet and warm. \n\nI really enjoyed the climb up Skiddaw: route finding immaculate; sun rising to the east; moon shining to the west and the twinkling lights of Keswick below. At the summit I was as happy as could be and then I started the difficult descent down Carl Side. I had recce'd this route with company in daylight and found it unpleasant; alone in the early dawn, I felt so very vulnerable. Near vertical scree negotiated, the ridge down was a joy and I was soon at the road crossing where I met David who ran with me to Bassenthwaite Church, arriving slightly ahead of schedule. \n\n![Steph and Stephen outside St Bega Church in Bassenthwaite](/content/images/2018/08/02_st_bega_bassenthwaite.jpg)\n\nStephen was waiting already in his wetsuit and off we went for our first swim across Bassenthwaite Lake. The water was much warmer than I had expected and a bit more choppy in the middle than I had hoped, but we were soon across and ready for Leg 2.\n\n![Emerging from Bassenthwaite Lake](/content/images/2018/08/03_bassenthwaite.jpg)\n \n## Leg 2: Barf, Lords Seat, Ullister Hill, Grisedale Pike, Hopegill Head, Sand Hill, Crag Hill, Wandope, Whiteless Pike and Rannerdale Knotts\n\nThis leg is the longest and in an area much less familiar to me. For this reason I had enlisted ace navigator Julie to help. Julie had thoroughly recce'd the route and I was confident that she would not lead me astray. Neil, also unfamiliar with the area, joined us for leg 2. \n\nIt was still early but the temperature was rising alarmingly as we set off on the first climb. The views were simply magnificent and I guess we spent a bit too much time admiring the scenery. However, at the top of Grisedale Pike it was apparent that we had a problem. Julie was really suffering with the heat and began to feel very ill. She was concerned that our slow pace was eating into the schedule and so an executive decision was made. Julie directed Neil and me towards the next two summits and then met up with us in the saddle before Crag Hill. She then sent us on our way with a firm reminder not to miss out Wandope (which is, apparently, easily done). Fortunately we had excellent visibility and with the help of Neil’s nifty watch thing we reached each checkpoint. \n\n![Entering Crummock Water](/content/images/2018/08/05_crummock_water.jpg)\n\nNeil had upped the pace, trying to make up for lost time and I really struggled in the heat to keep up but somehow we managed to reach Crummock Water only slightly behind schedule. I was already knackered and part of me wanted to give up but I didn’t want to let down the people who had given up their free time to help. Also, I desperately wanted to get in the lake and cool off. So off we went. Once again the swim was great, Stephen spotted Low Ling Crag and we managed a straight line until the exit point where I got tangled in some fishing line. I’m not sure I was ready for Leg 3 but it needed doing.\n \n## Leg 3: Melbreak (south summit), Red Pike, High Stile\nMatt was there as I crawled out of Crummock Water and helped me get the wetsuit off. There was food, water, dry socks, shoes and a fresh t-shirt waiting for me and Leg 3 began. \n\nIn theory this should be the easiest Leg but in practice it was hell. I had recce'd the route twice but had not managed to find a good way up Melbreak. I set Fiona off in front and tried to follow but the afternoon sun was debilitating. On a normal day I would do this climb without stopping but this day I had to keep resting. Fiona was wonderful, patient and jolly. \n\nThe climb up Red Pike was just as painful. However, the route down off High Stile posed the biggest problem as there doesn’t appear to be one. I didn’t find one during my recce and I didn’t find one on the day. We floundered around wasting time and eventually stumbled upon a path which we knew headed in the wrong direction. We took it anyway just grateful to be off the boulders and resigned ourselves to a couple of extra miles. \n\nWe arrived at Horse Close somewhat behind schedule but I had a plan to make up some time. I decided that a wetsuit was not required for the swim across Buttermere, thus saving transition time; Stephen agreed and we were correct. The water was lovely and I came out completely rejuvenated.\n \n## Leg 4: Robinson, Dale Head, High Spy, Catbells, Otterbield Island, St Herbert's Island, Rampshole Island, Moot Hall \n\nIt’s a tough climb up Robinson from Buttermere but I was feeling a bit more like my normal self – head down and get on with it. David had joined me for this section and we were watching the clock. The team had agreed that I needed to be in Derwent Water by 21.15 at the latest as I did not have a safety boat back-up. \n\nIt was a beautiful evening with excellent visibility and the temperature had fallen slightly so we upped the pace. We arrived at Otterbield Bay at 21:05, just in time to get the wetsuit on and get going on the final swim. However, Stephen, my swim buddy, was not there. I was devastated: I couldn’t go alone as he had my wetsuit (necessary for this much longer swim). I thought it was all over. David and I walked back towards the car park at the bottom of Catbells and bumped into Julie who had been waiting for us. Julie insisted that Stephen was at Otterbield Bay so we retraced out steps and found him. We had been on the wrong side and had somehow managed to miss him. \n\nBy this time it was approaching 22:00 and the light was fading. I said I wanted to swim but would accept Stephen’s decision. \n\n...\n\nStephen said yes. \n\nThe Derwent Water swim is the most challenging of the 4 and includes 3 islands which must be crossed on foot. I really enjoyed swimming from island to island, but did not enjoy the excruciatingly painful bare foot runs across sharp stones. There were people camping on St Herbert's Island who looked quite bemused as we emerged from the dark water, ran across the island and swam off the other side. \n\nIt was properly dark when we left Rampsholme Island but David and Julie were on the far shore with torches and as we swam towards the light, I thought of turtles swimming towards the moon. \n\nGetting out was difficult. No point fully removing the wetsuit so I put on some shoes and a t-shirt and trotted to Moot Hall.\n \nIt was party time in Keswick. There were lots of \"Bob Grahamers\" milling around and I got a few strange looks as I posed for my photograph on the steps. We popped into the pub for a pint of shandy and I bumped into an old friend, Peter Booth, from my Everest Marathon trip almost 13 years ago. He had been supporting a gent called Harry, aged 71 from Rossendale, on his Bob Graham Round. Much chatting and reminiscing, I didn’t feel tired at all, just happy and relieved and so very grateful to my brilliant team who gave up their time to help me have a proper adventure in my favourite place.\n\n&mdash; Steph Goodchild\n\n![Finished!](/content/images/2018/08/06_finish.jpg)",

The water was lovely and I came out completely rejuvenated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"leg4robinsondaleheadhighspycatbellsotterbieldislandstherbertsislandrampsholeislandmoothall\">Leg 4: Robinson, Dale Head, High Spy, Catbells, Otterbield Island, St Herbert's Island, Rampshole Island, Moot Hall</h2>\n\n<p>It’s a tough climb up Robinson from Buttermere but I was feeling a bit more like my normal self – head down and get on with it. David had joined me for this section and we were watching the clock. The team had agreed that I needed to be in Derwent Water by 21.15 at the latest as I did not have a safety boat back-up. </p>\n\n<p>It was a beautiful evening with excellent visibility and the temperature had fallen slightly so we upped the pace. We arrived at Otterbield Bay at 21:05, just in time to get the wetsuit on and get going on the final swim. However, Stephen, my swim buddy, was not there. I was devastated: I couldn’t go alone as he had my wetsuit (necessary for this much longer swim). I thought it was all over. David and I walked back towards the car park at the bottom of Catbells and bumped into Julie who had been waiting for us. Julie insisted that Stephen was at Otterbield Bay so we retraced out steps and found him. We had been on the wrong side and had somehow managed to miss him. </p>\n\n<p>By this time it was approaching 22:00 and the light was fading. I said I wanted to swim but would accept Stephen’s decision. </p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Stephen said yes. </p>\n\n<p>The Derwent Water swim is the most challenging of the 4 and includes 3 islands which must be crossed on foot. I really enjoyed swimming from island to island, but did not enjoy the excruciatingly painful bare foot runs across sharp stones. There were people camping on St Herbert's Island who looked quite bemused as we emerged from the dark water, ran across the island and swam off the other side. </p>\n\n<p>It was properly dark when we left Rampsholme Island but David and Julie were on the far shore with torches and as we swam towards the light, I thought of turtles swimming towards the moon. </p>\n\n<p>Getting out was difficult. No point fully removing the wetsuit so I put on some shoes and a t-shirt and trotted to Moot Hall.</p>\n\n<p>It was party time in Keswick. There were lots of \"Bob Grahamers\" milling around and I got a few strange looks as I posed for my photograph on the steps. We popped into the pub for a pint of shandy and I bumped into an old friend, Peter Booth, from my Everest Marathon trip almost 13 years ago. He had been supporting a gent called Harry, aged 71 from Rossendale, on his Bob Graham Round. Much chatting and reminiscing, I didn’t feel tired at all, just happy and relieved and so very grateful to my brilliant team who gave up their time to help me have a proper adventure in my favourite place.</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; Steph Goodchild</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/06_finish.jpg\" alt=\"Finished!\" /></p>",

Here’s what they said…\n\n## Joseph\n_Joined the Manchester YMCA Harriers at New Runner’s Night October 2017_\n\n![Joseph at Astley Park Cross Country](/content/images/2018/09/joseph-at-astley-park.jpeg)\n\n### Why did you want to join a running club?\n\nI'd been running for a while but after doing my first half marathon I was getting a bit more serious and the idea of taking on a full marathon had started to appeal more. I thought maybe I needed a bit more help than I could find just by searching for tips online.\n \n### Did you have any worries about it before and if so were they valid?\n\nI’m quite a shy and introverted type of person so I was a little intimidated by the idea of joining a running club. I was definitely a little anxious about introducing myself to a lot of new people, and also had a vague idea that I might not be a serious enough runner to join a club.\n\nLooking back I can say that both those worries were quickly forgotten. All the Harriers were so friendly and welcoming, it was easy to chat with everyone and the atmosphere was really relaxed. Going down on the New Runners Night was great because there were quite a few other new people in the same boat as me.\n\nAs for being worried about not being a “serious runner” that seems quite silly now. Pace is completely unimportant and there will always be someone to keep you company on a club run if you’re not the fastest or just want to take it easy.\n\n### How has your running improved since joining the Harriers?\n\nMy running has come on massively since I joined, I’ve taken more than 10 minutes off my half-marathon time from last year and I’m running times I couldn’t have imagined before. That’s pretty much all down to the support and advice that other Harriers have given me.\n \n### What's your favourite bit about being part of the Harriers?\n\nAlthough I’m delighted with the improvements I made in terms of times and fitness etc it’s definitely the social side of being a Harrier which has been the biggest positive for me. I’ve got involved with the cross country and races in the club championships, and it’s so much fun to do races as part of a team. It’s great seeing other Harriers put in great performances and hitting their targets, especially after seeing them put in so much hard work. \n \n### Has anything surprised you about being a Harrier or anything unexpected happened during your first year?\n\nI certainly didn’t expect to get involved with the cross country running (to be honest I only had the vaguest idea what it was when I joined) but that has been one of my favourite experiences since joining. It’s very much a team sport and you get a real buzz representing the Harriers.\n \n### Most memorable moment in the last year?\n\nProbably the Manchester Marathon in April, lots of Harriers ran it and plenty of others came to cheer us on. With the months of anticipation beforehand I felt a bit like a kid in the run up to Christmas waiting for the big day. In the end what I enjoyed most about it was seeing the other Harriers out on the course, having done so much of the training together it was a great to see everyone do so well.\n \n### What’s your favourite activity / race you've done since joining?\n\nAfter the marathon I was injured and couldn’t run at all for about three weeks. My first proper run back was the \"Piece of Cake 10K\", which was the first race in the club championships this year. It was a brilliant race on a beautiful day and there were loads of other Harriers in attendance, a great way to get back into running after an enforced rest. (Also there was cake at the end!)\n\n### And finally…\n\nI think for a lot of people running is a great way to work through any stress and an opportunity to just have a moment to yourself, that’s definitely still an important part of it for me. Since joining the club though I’ve gained so much enjoyment from the social side of running and I think it’s been a big part of maintaining my enthusiasm for running where as in the past I’ve blown a bit hot and cold. I’ve gone on a bit about races and marathons etc but what is essentially great about being a Harrier is the chance to hang about with a lot of lovely people, doing something we all enjoy.\n\n## Zulma\n\n_Zulma joined the Manchester YMCA Harriers in April 2017_\n\n![Zulma won the Morris Kaplan trophy for most improved runner in 2018](/content/images/2018/09/zulma-winning-the-morris-kaplan-trophy.jpg)\n\n### Why did you want to join a running club?\n\nBack in 2017 I was running - well speed walking - everyday with the goal to run a half-marathon, but I was lacking support to push me. I did research on my local running clubs and I found the Manchester YMCA Harriers. I was looking for something exiting, challenging and friendly with a cool vibe. I haven’t looked back since!\n\n### Did you have any worries about it before and if so were they valid?\n\nI had so many worries, such as not being able to keep up and holding everyone else up, or perhaps not performing as well as the group. But I was worrying for nothing - everyone made me feel welcome.\n\n### How has your running improved since joining the Harriers?\n\nI never dreamed of running this fast and I have improved my 5K and Half Marathon times considerably. I also completed my first marathon in Copenhagen in 3:39:05 - a Boston qualifier time! So I’ve gone from Manchester to New England in less than a year and a half. \n\n### What's your favourite bit about being part of the Harriers? \n\nCross country and social nights. For those running on road I highly recommend plucking up the courage and trying out cross country.\nEvery first Thursday of the month we do a shorter session then go out for a social night, where everyone can relax and jump into that well deserved drink. These are a chance to meet the wonderful varied personalities of the group.\n\n### Has anything surprised you about being a Harrier or anything unexpected happened during your first year? \n\nI was very excited about my first cross country race of the season. I was ready early, a new shiny pair of shoes and the offer a lift to the race - a chance for a bit of team bonding before the run. What can go wrong?\n \nIt was also wonderful that my husband and daughter decided to join me at the race and caught the tram to meet me there. We hit the road and instantly hit traffic. My husband had beat us to the start line and called saying, “did you hear that loud bang? That was the start of your race!” I was furious but laughing, as were we all. We eventually got there just in time to support the rest of the team in their later races! \n\n### Most memorable moment in the last year?\n\nWinning the Morris Kaplan trophy for \"Most Improved Runner\" - I was speechless!\n\n### What’s your favourite activity / race you've done since joining? \n\nI was so excited to run the Leigh cross country race that I sprinted the first few hundred meters! Realising of my mistake I tried to slow down. One of my fellow club members encouraged me to keep going saying we were almost at the finish - I don’t know what race she was in but we still had 4 miles to go!\n\n### And finally…\n\nI hold many wonderful memories, from track training to Copenhagen Marathon but last year I had a taste of marshalling. We held our annual club race at Blackleach and a runner came to me after the race and thanked me! It made my day.\n\nRunning is always a great challenge no matter how long you have been running. It doesn’t matter if you are brand new to it or if you are working on endurance or speed, but Manchester YMCA Harriers has everything! They will guide you, support you, and are always full of smiles!\n\n## Martin\n_Joined the Manchester YMCA Harriers after New Runners' Night October 2017_\n\n![Martin at the Alexandra Park 5K](/content/images/2018/09/martin-at-alexandra-park-5k.jpg)\n\n### Why did you want to join a running club?\n\n18 months of running up and down Princess Road prior to joining got a bit lonely!\n \n### Why did you choose the Harriers?\n\nI came across some friendly faces at South Manchester parkrun handing out flyers, went on the website and seeing a welcoming vibe decided to give it a go.\n \n### Did you have any worries about it before and if so were they valid?\n\nI was a little nervous but there were plenty of other starters on New Runners' Night so I wasn’t on my own. After speaking to a few members on the night I knew I didn’t need to be.\n \n### How has your running improved since joining the Harriers?\n\nHugely! My PBs have lowered and I did my first marathon in April - something I never would’ve done without group training with the Harriers on a Sunday morning.\n \n### What's your favourite bit about being part of the Harriers?\n\nRunning with others. It’s so much better, whether it’s flying round a track or a longer chatty run.\n \n### Most memorable moment in the last year?\n\nCrossing the marathon finish line! The feeling of sheer relief and legs feeling like jelly after putting in all those months of hard work. \n \n### And finally…\n\nWhether you want to improve your running, train for a particular goal or merely meet new people, this is the one for you.",

I haven’t looked back since!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"didyouhaveanyworriesaboutitbeforeandifsoweretheyvalid\">Did you have any worries about it before and if so were they valid?</h3>\n\n<p>I had so many worries, such as not being able to keep up and holding everyone else up, or perhaps not performing as well as the group. But I was worrying for nothing - everyone made me feel welcome.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"howhasyourrunningimprovedsincejoiningtheharriers\">How has your running improved since joining the Harriers?</h3>\n\n<p>I never dreamed of running this fast and I have improved my 5K and Half Marathon times considerably. I also completed my first marathon in Copenhagen in 3:39:05 - a Boston qualifier time! So I’ve gone from Manchester to New England in less than a year and a half. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatsyourfavouritebitaboutbeingpartoftheharriers\">What's your favourite bit about being part of the Harriers?</h3>\n\n<p>Cross country and social nights. For those running on road I highly recommend plucking up the courage and trying out cross country. <br />\nEvery first Thursday of the month we do a shorter session then go out for a social night, where everyone can relax and jump into that well deserved drink. These are a chance to meet the wonderful varied personalities of the group.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hasanythingsurprisedyouaboutbeingaharrieroranythingunexpectedhappenedduringyourfirstyear\">Has anything surprised you about being a Harrier or anything unexpected happened during your first year?</h3>\n\n<p>I was very excited about my first cross country race of the season. I was ready early, a new shiny pair of shoes and the offer a lift to the race - a chance for a bit of team bonding before the run. What can go wrong?</p>\n\n<p>It was also wonderful that my husband and daughter decided to join me at the race and caught the tram to meet me there. We hit the road and instantly hit traffic. My husband had beat us to the start line and called saying, “did you hear that loud bang? That was the start of your race!” I was furious but laughing, as were we all. We eventually got there just in time to support the rest of the team in their later races! </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mostmemorablemomentinthelastyear\">Most memorable moment in the last year?</h3>\n\n<p>Winning the Morris Kaplan trophy for \"Most Improved Runner\" - I was speechless!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatsyourfavouriteactivityraceyouvedonesincejoining\">What’s your favourite activity / race you've done since joining?</h3>\n\n<p>I was so excited to run the Leigh cross country race that I sprinted the first few hundred meters! Realising of my mistake I tried to slow down. One of my fellow club members encouraged me to keep going saying we were almost at the finish - I don’t know what race she was in but we still had 4 miles to go!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"andfinally\">And finally…</h3>\n\n<p>I hold many wonderful memories, from track training to Copenhagen Marathon but last year I had a taste of marshalling. We held our annual club race at Blackleach and a runner came to me after the race and thanked me! It made my day.</p>\n\n<p>Running is always a great challenge no matter how long you have been running. It doesn’t matter if you are brand new to it or if you are working on endurance or speed, but Manchester YMCA Harriers has everything! They will guide you, support you, and are always full of smiles!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"martin\">Martin</h2>\n\n<p><em>Joined the Manchester YMCA Harriers after New Runners' Night October 2017</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/09/martin-at-alexandra-park-5k.jpg\" alt=\"Martin at the Alexandra Park 5K\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whydidyouwanttojoinarunningclub\">Why did you want to join a running club?</h3>\n\n<p>18 months of running up and down Princess Road prior to joining got a bit lonely!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whydidyouchoosetheharriers\">Why did you choose the Harriers?</h3>\n\n<p>I came across some friendly faces at South Manchester parkrun handing out flyers, went on the website and seeing a welcoming vibe decided to give it a go.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"didyouhaveanyworriesaboutitbeforeandifsoweretheyvalid\">Did you have any worries about it before and if so were they valid?</h3>\n\n<p>I was a little nervous but there were plenty of other starters on New Runners' Night so I wasn’t on my own. After speaking to a few members on the night I knew I didn’t need to be.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"howhasyourrunningimprovedsincejoiningtheharriers\">How has your running improved since joining the Harriers?</h3>\n\n<p>Hugely! My PBs have lowered and I did my first marathon in April - something I never would’ve done without group training with the Harriers on a Sunday morning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatsyourfavouritebitaboutbeingpartoftheharriers\">What's your favourite bit about being part of the Harriers?</h3>\n\n<p>Running with others.

            "slug": "2018-new-york-city-marathon",
            "markdown": "On the 2nd November 2018 I headed out from home, bound for New York City filled with the familiar sense of nervous excitement that I get before every big race.  In a few days' time I'd be stood on the start line of the New York Marathon, and along with 53,000 lucky others I'd be taking in the sights and sounds of the Big Apple by racing around its five boroughs.  \n\nI'd read a number of reviews in the weeks leading up to the race to try and get an idea of what the course was like, and most had advised that this was a race to be enjoyed, but not one in which to attempt a PB.  \n\n![New York City Marathon route](/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_NYC_Marathon_Route.png)\n\nMuch of what I'd read had described the course as a tough one, with undulating hills and challenging bridge crossings as the route weaves its way through all 5 boroughs of the city; Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Manhattan.  \n\n![New York City Marathon course profile](/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_NYC_Course_Profile.png)\n\nAfter doing my research I knew that a PB would be tough ask, but my training block had gone really well, I'd recently set a big PB at Manchester Half Marathon, and most importantly I was healthy and injury free, so I arrived feeling confident.  I felt in good shape so my plan was to set off at PB pace or thereabouts and see what happens – I could always re-adjust later in the race if it wasn't happening.\n\n![New York City Marathon number pickup at the Expo](/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_Number_Pickup.png)\n_Number pickup at the Expo_\n\nTo get runners from Manhattan to the start of the race on Staten Island, the organisers provide a choice of free ferry or bus transport to the start.  However, to get so many people there in good time for the start, the transport leaves early... **really early**.  I went for the bus option, and my allotted pickup time was 5.30am outside the magnificent New York Public Library.  With my alarm set for 4.15am, I ate a quick breakfast, picked up my gear check bag and joined the throngs of other runners as we filed to meet the buses in the pitch dark of the brisk November morning.  The organisation was really efficient; after only a short wait to get through a security checkpoint, the buses were lined up and ready to go so I joined my fellow runners as we embarked on the 45- minute ride to Staten Island.\n\nDuring the bus journey, I could overhear runners exchanging stories, advice and snippets of information that they'd picked up about the course, whilst dawn was slowly breaking to our left in the skies above Brooklyn.  Before too long we arrived at the start area in Fort Wadsworth, greeted by our first sight of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge which connects Staten Island and Brooklyn, and on which we would shortly be lining up to start the race.  After another quick security check we arrived in the enormous pre-start area, underneath the clear blue skies of a beautiful but chilly autumn morning – perfect weather conditions for a run.\n\nWith the race not due to start until 9.50am, there was over 3 hours to kill; in the lead-up to the race I was dreading this period.  With so many runners participating (this race would set a record for the highest ever number of runners in a marathon), I was concerned that 3 hours in the pre-start area would be claustrophobic and that there may not be enough facilities - however my fears were unfounded, and on the contrary the organisation was truly excellent.  There were separate \"villages\" corresponding to the 3 separate start areas (Green, Blue and Orange) and there was more than enough room for everyone to sit and relax, a plentiful supply of portaloos with hardly any queues (essential), and free supply of coffee, water, pastries and even free beanies were handed out to help keep warm.\n\n![New York City Marathon race villages](/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_NYC_Race_Villages.png)\n\nAt 6.30am on a November morning I was expecting it to be cold, and those who know me won't be surprised to hear that I had taken plenty of layers to wear beforehand (I tend feel the cold more than most!).  Most of my layers would get packed in a gear check bag to be transported to the finish area, but I also had an old hoodie that I could wear right up until the last moment, and then discard just before the start so as to stay warm for as long as possible.\n\nBefore too long it was 8.30 and time to start getting ready.  The race was due to start at 9.50 but the start corrals opened at 8.50.  There are 3 separate start areas at NYC which funnel the runners into slightly different routes for the first 5k to help ease congestion, which is similar to the start at the London Marathon.  \n\nAfter checking my gear bag and one last loo stop, I made my way to the green start holding area, underneath the intimidating sight of the Verrazano Bridge from where we'd shortly be starting the race.  \n\n![New York City Marathon pre-start area and view of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge](/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_NYC_Pre_Start.png)\n_Pre-start area and view of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge_\n\nAfter a short wait of approximately 15 minutes, Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\" came blasting out over the PA which was the signal for my corral to start making our way up onto the bridge itself and towards the start line.  As runners congregated on the start line in the final few moments, nervous glances were exchanged along with last words of encouragement.  After a spine-tingling rendition of the Stars and Stripes, and a message from the race director, the starting cannon sounded and finally we were off, racing over the bridge towards Brooklyn!  \n\nAfter the steady first mile of ascent getting onto the bridge itself where I held back a bit, the next few miles consisted of steady but fast undulations and I hit 10k feeling good but just behind target pace.   \n\nThe atmosphere and support out on the course through Brooklyn and Williamsburg (and throughout) was superb.  The streets were absolutely lined with people yelling out messages of support and holding up funny banners which raised a smile and provided moments of welcome distraction as I went past (there seems to be far more of this in the USA than in the UK, everyone seemed to have one!), and there were live bands and DJs set up every few hundred yards it seemed, it was so much fun and hard to keep the pace steady and not to get carried away in the excitement of it all.  And of course, the views of the Manhattan skyline from where we were in Brooklyn, especially on such a clear day were totally awe inspiring, I couldn't take my eyes off the view!\n\nFrom miles 8 to 13 as the course moved north towards Queens, the undulations had gotten a little more challenging.  My plan beforehand had been to ease off on the hills and run them steadily so as not to risk blowing up early – this meant I lost a little bit more time and hit half way a couple of minutes behind PB pace, which I knew would be difficult to make up given that the second half of the course is the tougher of the two.  I also knew that I was running a fantastic race and if I could hold the pace steady in the second half there was a real chance of posting a time that would be the second-quickest I'd ever ran.  This was my new target.\n\nAfter the halfway mark, the next point I'd been focussing on was mile 16 which takes the runners over the Queensboro Bridge from Brooklyn into Manhattan.  I'd been past the bridge during a taxi ride on the previous day and so I'd gotten a close-up look at it – and as my friend pointed out, it looked _imposing_!\n\nComing at mile 16, which I knew from past experience is usually the point that things start to get tough in the marathon, mentally I'd prepared myself that this would be the _real_ start of the race.  I also knew however that my cheering crew of friends and family would be stationed immediately on the other side of the bridge, so whilst I wasn't looking forward to the climb, I knew the welcome sight of my loved ones on the other side would provide a much-needed boost.  \n\nJust before the mile 15 marker the route turned 90-degrees left and started long gradual run up onto the lower level of the double-deck bridge.  With no spectators allowed on the bridges it was a strange experience; almost total silence other than the sounds of runners' footsteps on the tarmac.  The climb wasn't terribly steep, it just seemed to go on forever, and again I purposely took it easy until hitting the crest of the bridge after a mile or so then careered down the welcome (and pretty steep) downhill on the other side.\n\nThe crowd of people waiting to greet the runners' arrival into Manhattan was monumental, this must have been the spot where many people had picked to spot their runners, and my personal highlight of the race.  It was amazing to go from the eerie calmness on the bridge to be hit with a wall of noise on the other side, it felt like running into a stadium!  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to spot my group in amongst the tens of thousands of people that had gathered there, but I should have feared not; they knew I was coming, had already spotted me and were cheering louder than anyone else there.  I was able to take a detour and give them a fist pump and big smile, before floating off on a cloud of their encouragement – I felt great (for a bit)!\n\n![Fist-pumping at mile 16 of the New York City Marathon](/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_NYC_Fist_Pump.png)\n\nAfter entering Manhattan, the route turns north onto 1st Avenue towards the Bronx, and there is a relatively flat and perfectly straight 3-4 mile section where I was able to settle back into a good pace, and I hit 30k feeling in good shape but I knew the hard work would start soon.  \n\nThe route enters the Bronx at mile 20 when it crosses the Willis Avenue Bridge and it was at was this point when I noticed that I was working much harder than I had been previously to maintain pace. We crossed the final bridge of the day to enter Harlem at 21.5 and then back into Manhattan for one last time as we headed towards the finish.  My legs were really starting to feel the strain by this point; my mile splits had dropped by approximately 20 seconds, and I could feel the tell-tale twinges from my calves that indicated cramp could set in at any moment.   I decided it was better not to push too hard to make up time, and instead I aimed to keep a steady pace so as to push back the onset of cramp, which I've suffered with in the late stages of races before.  I was still on for a fantastic performance and just needed to hold it together.\n\nThe final stages of the route heads south towards Central Park on the famous 5th Avenue, but before it reached the park there was one last hill to negotiate between mile 23 and 24.  The crowd support again was fantastically encouraging, urging runners up the hill although I couldn't acknowledge them quite as much as I'd have liked to, other than the occasional wave and grimace by that point!  At mile 24 the route finally sweeps quickly right and left as it enters Central Park which was a fantastic feeling.  I knew the hard work was all done and now I could enjoy the amazing experience of those iconic last couple of miles through the park.  At mile 25 I spotted my cheer crew for the last time as they shouted and waved me into the last mile and a wave of euphoria swept over me as I turned the final corner into the finishing straight.  I felt amazing and gave it my all in an attempt at a sprint finish, but with the finish line in sight I was struck with a sudden cramp spasm in both calves and had to stop dead and stretch out until it passed! So frustrating but after a few seconds I got going again and made it across the line with a time of 2:47:13 – my second-fastest ever marathon, and my fastest on foreign soil. I was overjoyed and couldn't stop smiling as I collected my medal and made my way up to the exit areas, high-fiving everyone in sight.  Within half an hour I was with my family and friends in a New York bar, and the real party could begin.\n\n![Post-race refreshments after the New York City Marathon](/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_NYC_Post_Race.png)\n\nThank you NYC - you put on a fantastic race!!!\n\n&mdash; Craig Jones\n\n",

            "html": "<p>On the 2nd November 2018 I headed out from home, bound for New York City filled with the familiar sense of nervous excitement that I get before every big race.  In a few days' time I'd be stood on the start line of the New York Marathon, and along with 53,000 lucky others I'd be taking in the sights and sounds of the Big Apple by racing around its five boroughs.  </p>\n\n<p>I'd read a number of reviews in the weeks leading up to the race to try and get an idea of what the course was like, and most had advised that this was a race to be enjoyed, but not one in which to attempt a PB.  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_NYC_Marathon_Route.png\" alt=\"New York City Marathon route\" /></p>\n\n<p>Much of what I'd read had described the course as a tough one, with undulating hills and challenging bridge crossings as the route weaves its way through all 5 boroughs of the city; Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Manhattan.  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_NYC_Course_Profile.png\" alt=\"New York City Marathon course profile\" /></p>\n\n<p>After doing my research I knew that a PB would be tough ask, but my training block had gone really well, I'd recently set a big PB at Manchester Half Marathon, and most importantly I was healthy and injury free, so I arrived feeling confident.  I felt in good shape so my plan was to set off at PB pace or thereabouts and see what happens – I could always re-adjust later in the race if it wasn't happening.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/12/2018-12-02_Number_Pickup.png\" alt=\"New York City Marathon number pickup at the Expo\" />\n<em>Number pickup at the Expo</em></p>\n\n<p>To get runners from Manhattan to the start of the race on Staten Island, the organisers provide a choice of free ferry or bus transport to the start.  However, to get so many people there in good time for the start, the transport leaves early... <strong>really early</strong>.  I went for the bus option, and my allotted pickup time was 5.30am outside the magnificent New York Public Library.  With my alarm set for 4.15am, I ate a quick breakfast, picked up my gear check bag and joined the throngs of other runners as we filed to meet the buses in the pitch dark of the brisk November morning.  The organisation was really efficient; after only a short wait to get through a security checkpoint, the buses were lined up and ready to go so I joined my fellow runners as we embarked on the 45- minute ride to Staten Island.</p>\n\n<p>During the bus journey, I could overhear runners exchanging stories, advice and snippets of information that they'd picked up about the course, whilst dawn was slowly breaking to our left in the skies above Brooklyn.  Before too long we arrived at the start area in Fort Wadsworth, greeted by our first sight of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge which connects Staten Island and Brooklyn, and on which we would shortly be lining up to start the race.

            "markdown": "With the Christmas and New Year festivities over for another year, I am already deep into another training block as I prepare for my next marathon.  I had to make an early start this year as the race I’m targeting is very early in the calendar compared to other spring marathons (March 3rd), and this particular race will represent a special milestone for me.  I am training for Tokyo marathon which will see me complete the series of races known as the Abbott World Marathon Majors, and with the finish line in sight, I thought I’d share the story of my journey to the “Big Six”.\n\nThe Abbot World Major Marathons is a series consisting of six of the most renowned big city marathons from around the world, which are; London, Berlin, New York City, Chicago, Boston and Tokyo.  Those who are lucky enough to complete all six are presented with a special commemorative \"6-star finisher's medal\" as they cross the finish line of their last race, and they join a select band of 6-star finishers who have completed all six races.\n\n![The Abbott World Majors six-star medal](/content/images/2019/02/six-star-medal.jpg)\n\nBetween 30,000 and 50,000 runners participate in each of these races every year but at the time of writing only approximately 4,000 people have completed all 6 since the series format started in 2006, and only around 300 of those are from the UK.  \n\n\n### Berlin 2014\n \nMy journey towards the Big Six very nearly ended before it had begun, as in my first marathon at Manchester in 2013 I'd hit the dreaded \"wall\" so hard in the last six miles that I swore I'd never run another.  That rather hasty vow was quickly forgotten however, and before too long I was keen to have another crack at 26.2, and was eagerly researching races a bit further afield for added excitement.  I settled on Berlin as I'd visited there before, loved it and had been itching to go back ever since.  Entering the marathon there seemed the perfect excuse to go back and properly explore the city, however at the time I was still completely unaware of the World Marathon Majors or that Berlin was one of them.  Incidentally, it was around this time that I plucked up the courage to try going along to a running club, as previously I'd been doing all my training alone, and so I came across a small local club on my doorstep called the Manchester YMCA Harriers and I've never looked back since!\n\n![Craig at the 2014 Berlin Marathon](/content/images/2019/02/craig-at-berlin.jpg)\n\nBerlin was my first race experience outside of the UK, it was my first big city race and I was blown away by the scale of the event compared with the limited number of local races I'd run at home.  Having to attend a huge expo the day before the race to collect your bib was all new and very exciting, as was arriving in the vast athlete's village outside the Reichstag on the crisp autumn morning of the race.  Berlin is well known as being a fast course, and indeed the last 7 world records have all been set there.  The reputation is well deserved, the course is flat and fast if you're looking for a fast time as well as a fantastic experience, this one should be on your list.  With the help of the Harriers, I'd already made big improvements in just the 3 months that I'd been training with them, and this translated into a brilliant run which saw me take a massive 15 minutes off my previous best.  Berlin also whetted my appetite for the added excitement of races on foreign soil, and from that day I knew that combining my love of travel and running was something that I'd be keen to do more of in future; I was hooked!\n\n### London 2015\n\nIn 2015 I was lucky enough to receive the Harriers' club place for the London Marathon (that's right folks; each year the Harriers receives one place for the London marathon which is awarded to a member based on certain eligibility criteria – bear this in mind and if you're interested, [contact the club](/contact) or ask one of the [committee members](/about#committee) for more details on how you can claim it), and it was only when I was collecting my bib number at the expo that I became aware of The Big Six for the first time.  I noticed a stand that was promoting something called the Abbott World Marathon Majors, and there was a wall which listed the names of all those who had completed the series.  It was then that I first became aware of the concept and was captivated by the thought of what an exciting proposition it would be to do all of the races, and to join the list of names on that wall.  It occurred to me that I was about to complete my second race in the series, but I didn't contemplate at the time that I would eventually be in a position to complete all six, but little did I know: a seed was planted that day.\n\nHaving watched the brilliant and inspiring coverage of the London Marathon on TV every year since I can remember, to actually be participating in the event and running past those famous landmarks was fantastic.  London is famous for its fantastic support out on the course and this reputation is definitely well deserved; the atmosphere builds as you work your way through the course, with each of the boroughs of the city bringing its own distinct personality to the support, but the crescendo of noise as the runners come into the final miles on Embankment before turning right at Big Ben, passing Buckingham Palace as you enter the famous finishing stretch on The Mall, was truly something to remember.  My training for London had been badly interrupted by knee surgery and a subsequent two-month layoff, during which I'd doubted whether I'd ever get back to running properly again, so just to make it to the start line felt like a massive achievement but the combination of adrenalin and the amazing support from the crowds powered me onto a fantastic run, and one which I now look back on with immense pride.\n\n### Boston 2017\n \nI was now two majors down but it was only when fellow Harrier Mark Griffiths and I started making plans to enter the iconic Boston marathon in 2017 did I believe that completing the series was a possibility.\n\n![Craig at the 2017 Boston Marathon](/content/images/2019/02/craig-at-boston.jpg)\n\nBoston is the holy-grail for many marathon runners; perhaps because it is the oldest of all annually held marathons (it was first run in 1897 and next year will be the 123rd race in its history, in which our very own Sarah Crandon and Zulma Edmondson will be competing); or perhaps it is because of the famous undulating point-to-point route that starts in the tiny town of Hopkinton, 26 miles outside of Boston from where the runners race back into Boston; or perhaps it is because it is the only major that doesn't have a ballot entry system, meaning that you have to achieve a strict qualifying standard just be able to apply, giving it a certain mystique amongst marathon runners; or maybe it is the race's illustrious history that makes it so alluring.  \n\nMost notably it was the event that was the catalyst which opened the way for women's marathon running, even though to do so it took the courage of two women who broke the ridiculous rules of the day that prevented women from competing in races of longer than 1.5 miles.  The first - Bobbi Gibb - wasn't an official entrant in 1966 but made her stand by joining the course at the start of the race and completed the full distance, unbeknownst to race officials. A year later in 1967, Kathrine Switzer registered under her initials rather than her full name in order to be allocated a bib number, and she completed the race despite efforts by race officials to force her off the course and out of the race, when they became aware that she was running.  \n\n![Race organisers tried to force Kathrine Switzer off the course in 1967, but a fellow University student helped keep her on track.](/content/images/2019/02/kathrine-switzer.jpg)\n\nAlthough it wasn't until 1972 that women were officially allowed to participate, Gibb and Switzer's courageous and principled stands against the archaic rules of the time changed the face of running forever, and when you arrive in Boston to participate in its magnificent race, the history it carries hangs tangibly in the air all around you.  It is truly a special event and my experience at Boston, my first outside of Europe was so inspiring that from that moment there was no doubt about it – I was gunning for the World Marathon Majors!\n\n### Chicago 2017\n \nAfter Boston, I was immediately plotting my route to the Big Six.  Chicago was six months away and I'd already made the decision that I would be running.  I have friends from Chicago and we'd already talked about how exciting it would be to visit the city for my first time and to run in the marathon.  I'd even convinced one of my friends to run it himself.  It was a no-brainer, Chicago would be next.\n\n![Craig at the 2017 Chicago Marathon](/content/images/2019/02/craig-at-chicago.jpg)\n\nOn the right day, Chicago is without doubt a PB course - it is flat and fast, possibly the flattest course I've raced on to-date.  The start area in Grant Park is spectacular; sandwiched in-between the tranquil shores of Lake Michigan on one side and the famous skyline of downtown Chicago on the other, and the route takes runners through the various districts of the city, and like all of the Big Six races, the support on the course is tremendous.  It was a brilliant race that I'd highly recommend, plus the ballot entry system isn't quite as highly subscribed as some of the other big races which makes it a little easier to get into.  A combination of a very early start time (7.30am race start!), a baking hot day, and bad race strategy on my behalf saw me struggle in the last few miles but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of a wonderful event and of the city itself.  \n\n### New York City 2018\n \nNext up, 12 months later was New York City, which was a totally awe inspiring experience and is definitely a \"bucket list\" race.  For all the details about the NYC marathon, [read my dedicated blog](https://www.manyharrier.co.uk/2018-new-york-city-marathon).\n\n![Craig at the 2018 New York City Marathon](/content/images/2019/02/craig-at-new-york.jpg)\n\n### Tokyo 2019?\n\nFive down and only one to go – Tokyo, which takes place on 3rd March 2019, only weeks away at the time I'm writing this, and the excitement for what is in store is really starting to build.  Japan has been on my list of places that I've wanted to go to for as long as I can remember but I've never quite managed to get there, until now.  And that brings me to one of my favourite aspects of this journey towards the Big Six – it has taken me to places around the world that perhaps I would not otherwise have visited; I've been able to combine my love of running and travel, and the adventures that I've experienced along the way will stay with me forever.  I've also been very lucky that I've been able to share those experiences with my amazing group of friends and family who do an incredible job in coming to support me in these races, and more importantly – helping me to celebrate afterwards!\n\nGetting there though has been a challenge, and I suppose that there are reasons why only a relatively small number of people have completed the Big Six so far.  Finishing the series means running at least six marathons – a tough ask in itself, which requires the continued motivation to get through training block after training block, year after year.  The cost of travel, accommodation and entry can be prohibitive. (The American races in particular are very expensive to enter when compared with London for example.)  And finally; simply gaining entry into the majors can be difficult; whilst all of the races have guaranteed entry routes for those who have achieved specified qualifying times, many runners' primary entry route will be the ballot processes which can often only offer a very slim chance of entry given the sheer volume of applications submitted, compared to the limited number of available places.  As I've mentioned above; Boston doesn't have a ballot entry option, so most runners will have to meet (and better) the strict qualifying standards in order to participate.\n  \nThere are also other possible routes of entry to consider if none of those listed above are successful, and these include charity places, which require a commitment to raise a minimum amount of charity funding; or Sports Tour companies who offer packages with a guaranteed entry place included, although again these can be expensive.\n\nHowever, regardless of the challenges, this journey has been a wonderfully exciting and rewarding adventure from start to finish.  I've loved every minute of it and there's still one more leg to go - that 6-star medal is so close, I can almost touch it – watch this space for my review of Tokyo!\n\n![Craig's Abbott World Marathon Majors certificate - five down, one to go](/content/images/2019/02/abbott-world-majors-certificate.png)\n\n&mdash; Craig Jones",

The start area in Grant Park is spectacular; sandwiched in-between the tranquil shores of Lake Michigan on one side and the famous skyline of downtown Chicago on the other, and the route takes runners through the various districts of the city, and like all of the Big Six races, the support on the course is tremendous.  It was a brilliant race that I'd highly recommend, plus the ballot entry system isn't quite as highly subscribed as some of the other big races which makes it a little easier to get into.  A combination of a very early start time (7.30am race start!), a baking hot day, and bad race strategy on my behalf saw me struggle in the last few miles but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of a wonderful event and of the city itself.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"newyorkcity2018\">New York City 2018</h3>\n\n<p>Next up, 12 months later was New York City, which was a totally awe inspiring experience and is definitely a \"bucket list\" race.  For all the details about the NYC marathon, <a href=\"https://www.manyharrier.co.uk/2018-new-york-city-marathon\">read my dedicated blog</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2019/02/craig-at-new-york.jpg\" alt=\"Craig at the 2018 New York City Marathon\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tokyo2019\">Tokyo 2019?</h3>\n\n<p>Five down and only one to go – Tokyo, which takes place on 3rd March 2019, only weeks away at the time I'm writing this, and the excitement for what is in store is really starting to build.  Japan has been on my list of places that I've wanted to go to for as long as I can remember but I've never quite managed to get there, until now.  And that brings me to one of my favourite aspects of this journey towards the Big Six – it has taken me to places around the world that perhaps I would not otherwise have visited; I've been able to combine my love of running and travel, and the adventures that I've experienced along the way will stay with me forever.  I've also been very lucky that I've been able to share those experiences with my amazing group of friends and family who do an incredible job in coming to support me in these races, and more importantly – helping me to celebrate afterwards!</p>\n\n<p>Getting there though has been a challenge, and I suppose that there are reasons why only a relatively small number of people have completed the Big Six so far.  Finishing the series means running at least six marathons – a tough ask in itself, which requires the continued motivation to get through training block after training block, year after year.  The cost of travel, accommodation and entry can be prohibitive. (The American races in particular are very expensive to enter when compared with London for example.)  And finally; simply gaining entry into the majors can be difficult; whilst all of the races have guaranteed entry routes for those who have achieved specified qualifying times, many runners' primary entry route will be the ballot processes which can often only offer a very slim chance of entry given the sheer volume of applications submitted, compared to the limited number of available places.  As I've mentioned above; Boston doesn't have a ballot entry option, so most runners will have to meet (and better) the strict qualifying standards in order to participate.</p>\n\n<p>There are also other possible routes of entry to consider if none of those listed above are successful, and these include charity places, which require a commitment to raise a minimum amount of charity funding; or Sports Tour companies who offer packages with a guaranteed entry place included, although again these can be expensive.</p>\n\n<p>However, regardless of the challenges, this journey has been a wonderfully exciting and rewarding adventure from start to finish.  I've loved every minute of it and there's still one more leg to go - that 6-star medal is so close, I can almost touch it – watch this space for my review of Tokyo!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2019/02/abbott-world-majors-certificate.png\" alt=\"Craig's Abbott World Marathon Majors certificate - five down, one to go\" /></p>\n\n<p>&mdash; Craig Jones</p>",

            "markdown": "I received an email from the UTMB (Ultra Trail Mont Blanc) people informing me of a new series of races called Ushuaia Fin Del Mundo based in Terra Del Fuego, Argentinian Patagonia. They were offering 4 distances: 35k; 50k; 70k and 130k with no entry criteria, no ballot and masses of ITRA (International Trail Running Association) points awarded upon completion. It was a no brainer for me. I’d always wanted to go to Patagonia and it would tick off continent number five in my plan to race marathon distance or further on every continent. Also the fact that it was a brand new race appealed to me. The UTMB races have been going for some years now and, in my opinion, have been spoiled by over subscription.\n \nIt took a total of 36 hours to get to Ushuaia, the most southerly city in the world. The journey included 3 flights and a frantic bus trip across Buenos Aries. I finally arrived late in the evening on Thursday 4th April giving me just one day to rest and prepare.\n \nThe Patagonian scenery was stunning. Snow capped mountains rising from the sea - the only blot on the landscape being man-made. The race literature describes Patagonia as one of the wildest and unpredictable places on Earth.\n \nFriday was registration day where a thorough kit inspection was carried out to ensure that runners complied with the extensive mandatory kit requirements. Passports, medical certificates and insurance providers were also checked. (Although, I’m not entirely sure my Post Office worldwide, annual, multi trip insurance policy covers helicopter rescue in Patagonia!) We were tagged and given a t-shirt and a fleece.\n \nApril is autumn in Patagonia, cold and wet but apparently less windy than the other 3 seasons and so I was wrapped up in all my mandatory kit at 6:00am on Saturday morning for the bus trip to the start line at Playa Larga. There was no shelter at the start so, in an attempt to keep warm, we huddled like penguins and stomped our feet in time with the rave music blaring out of the loud speaker. I was feeling very apprehensive and almost got back on the bus. I gave myself a good talking to and came to the conclusion that I had nothing better to do that day so I might as well just get on with it. At 7:30am dawn broke and we were off.\n \nThe first few miles were lovely, easy running along the beach and then up into the woods. I soon warmed up and the first checkpoint came quickly. I was being lulled into a false sense of security. The trouble started at 23km in the Valle de Lobos. The route was hideous, a quagmire with an icy top where each step was into freezing mud up to the knees. This continued for some miles until we began to climb. The route then took us up a stream and as we got higher the water froze and we used our hands to scramble up near vertical ice covered rocks. And then the wind came, blowing icy shards into our faces.\n \nAfter a steep climb often comes a steep descent and the descent of Paso Bonette was no exception. The route down was treacherous, ice covered rocks and a howling gale. It was slow going and very scary, runners were falling all around. I kept my centre of gravity as low as possible and inched my way down. Eventually back in the tree line the rocks petered out and we returned to mud.\n \nI reached Checkpoint 5 (Mosca Loca), the half way point, over two hours ahead of the cut off at 18:30. An official kindly informed me that the cut-off times had been altered and 18:30 was now the cut-off time for the next checkpoint 10 miles away at Natatorio. I was uncertain if I should continue, as the race profile showed another mountain, Cerro Medio, higher and steeper than Paso Bonette, the one I had just negotiated. The official assured me that this mountain was less severe and that I had done the hardest part. I found that hard to believe but pressed on anyway, as I had nothing better to do that day.\n \nThe climb up Cero Medio started innocuous enough, up through the trees, manageable quantities of mud and as dusk fell and I put my headtorch on, I felt an eerie thrill following the reflective markers up the tail. Despite the climb I was getting cold so I put on an extra layer, my hat and my last dry pair of gloves. Then it started to snow I was concerned about conditions further up the trail and considered returning to Natatorio but it was only one mountain and I can always manage another mountain, so I soldiered on. Once through the tree line we were confronted by a full on blizzard which worsened as we trudged up the seemingly endless climb. It was completely dark by now so fortunately I couldn’t see the full extent of the drop to my right. Checkpoint reached it was just a small matter of over the summit and down the other side. A man appeared out of the gloom and said “descent very dangerous” and I thought, \"No sh*t, Sherlock!\" I have been on mountains in similar conditions to this before, however, I have always had: goggles; boots; crampons; ice axe; harness; rope; mountaineering guide and daylight.  This was simply foolhardy. My trail shoes were woefully inadequate but I had no option but to continue, staying put would soon result in hypothermia. The blizzard raged, visibility was poor and the route markers were almost impossible to spot. A small group of us stuck together gaining comfort from having company. This was not a race, this was survival.\n \nEventually I reached the trees which offered some protection from the blizzard and the ground became less steep. It was then that I realised how cold I had become. It was a long run in to the finish but I could not warm up. I could see the lights of Ushuaia, a city that looks its best at night from a distance, and yearned for my basic but comfy hotel.\n \nI felt nothing but relief at the finish. They gave me a splendid medal to add to my collection and I was assisted by a lovely man called Juan who spoke excellent English. He fetched me a hot chocolate and offered me a hot bath, which I declined. He then told me that the cut off times had been amended due to the deteriorating weather to avoid having the slowest runners exposed on the mountain. He then organised a taxi to take me back to my hotel.\n \nIt’s a miracle that no-one died that night and I’m sure I’ve used up another of my 9 lives, but after all, I really had nothing better to do that day.\n \n### Race stats\n\n* My finish time was 15 hours and 56 minutes\n* 28 different nationalities took part.

            "markdown": "Following the tough conditions experienced at the Kentmere Horsehoe Fell Race last year, we’ve organised a navigation course for those who expressed an interest in improving their navigation and navigational techniques.\n\nThe course will be led by experienced personal trainers [Lynne Taylor](http://www.globaltherapies.com/about-us/lynne-taylor/) and [Tim Budd](http://www.globaltherapies.com/about-us/tim-budd/), from Glossop based Global Therapies.\n\nThe date is set for Saturday 20 July, and we expect to start at 9:00am from Old Glossop and finish around 3:00pm.

            "markdown": "Before this year, I had run London once before in 2013.  I have to admit, I didn't particularly enjoy it.  I didn't have a good run and sometimes when you feel like that you don't want thousands of people cheering you on along the way!  But I had a \"good for age\" and \"Boston qualifier\" after Manchester Marathon 2018: I couldn't be bothered to travel to Boston, so that left London.\n\nGiven my 2013 experience, I was a little apprehensive going into this year.  People say London isn't a PB course: too busy, you'll run further than 26.2, it's often HOT. However, my training had gone really well, I'd run more miles than ever and conditions on the day were cool and dry.  I didn't have any excuses.  The day before, Mark, who I have run with for the entirety of my nine-year career at the Harriers text me and said: \"be brave and commit\".  I kept that mantra in mind as I travelled to the start line.\n\n![Hannah at London](/content/images/2019/06/2019-london-hb-3.jpeg)\n\nThere were four Harriers running this year at London – myself, Craig Jones, Joe Hayes and Heather Hughes.  We were lucky to be joined by a contingent of supporters from the club including, Chris, Jen, Sarah Wilson, Emma Rettig, Graeme, Phil and our London representative, Pete.  I also had Kev, all the Brierleys and a group of my University friends out on the course.\n\nThere are over 40,000 runners at the London marathon and 3 different starts.  I was in the smallish green start which is good as there are less than 10,000 runners so you get over the line quickly – apparently, it's the celeb start too but I didn't spot any.  Our Craig was in the championship start (sub 3:15 women and sub 2:45 men if you're interested) so he was warming up with Mo!\n\n![Craig... just behind Mo](/content/images/2019/06/2019-london-cj-2.jpeg)\n\nThe course starts in Blackheath, snaking its way to Greenwich and the Cutty Sark.  It crosses Tower Bridge and the river just before halfway followed by an out and back section including a loop around Canary Wharf.  Finally, the route makes its way along the Thames, past Embankment to Big Ben and then turning towards Buckingham Palace and the iconic finish on the Mall. \n\nI had decided to set off at about 3 hours 20 minute pace (just under 7:40 minutes per mile) which I knew would be a bit of a gamble.  At the start, I forced myself not to get carried away – easily done as the mile 3 is a big downhill.  I concentrated on locking into a steady pace and after about 6 miles or so this started to feel comfortable.\n\n![Hannah in Greenwich](/content/images/2019/06/2019-london-hb-1.jpeg)\n\nThe atmosphere at London is electric pretty much the entire time but there are certain points which will give you goosebumps – the Cutty Sark at mile 6 is one, Tower Bridge just before halfway is insane and the final 2-3 miles is pretty much a wall of noise.  It's incredible!\n\nThis does make it quite difficult to spot your supporters.  My biggest tip is to know where they are going to be so you can look out for them.   I knew roughly where everyone was and managed to see Kev twice, Sarah twice, uni friends twice, Harriers twice and Brierleys 3 times – as well as 2 appearances from Heather's sister.  It’s such a boost to see your supporters and know where to look for them.\n\nI managed to maintain a fairly steady pace until mile 16/17 where I had a bit of a wobble – it was starting to feel a bit tough, was this going to be the beginning of a very difficult 10 miles?  This has happened to me before and it's a long way to go when you feel rubbish.  Thankfully, I saw Kev around this point and also had a gel – somehow, this gave me a second wind and I suddenly felt good again.  Mile 19 was my fastest mile.\n\n![Hannah going strong](/content/images/2019/06/2019-london-hb-2.jpeg)\n\nI continued to feel strong for the next 5-6 miles.  If you feel good at this point, it's a massive advantage because everyone around you is flagging.  I must have passed hundreds of people and it really is a death march for some to the finish.  After mile 23 I was starting to feel tired again but at that point I knew I only had a couple of miles to go and knew I was on for a PB, barring disaster.  Mark's mantra was running through my mind the whole time and I held on to that thought until the finish. (As well as counting to 100 over and over again for the final 2 miles – if it works for Paula Radcliffe...)\n\nIt's difficult to describe that last mile past Big Ben towards Buckingham Palace and the Mall.  It's iconic.  I made sure I soaked it all in and used the crowd around me.  London is worth doing just for that.\n\nI was over the moon to cross the line in 3 hours 23 minutes.  A 6 minute PB and a time I am really proud of – somehow, I managed a very consistent race with only 30 seconds between my fastest and slowest miles.  It's an amazing feeling when all that hard work and training pays off.\n\n![Joe Hayes at London](/content/images/2019/06/2019-london-jh-1.jpeg)\n\nAt the finish I met with Heather, Craig and Joe – all of whom had run fantastic times of 2:37:28 Craig, 3:12:59 Joe and 3:29:44 Heather (despite being injured) – 4 Harriers, 4 PBs, a clean sweep!  We met up with all the supporters later for pizza and beers (obvs) and had a proper celebration.\n\n![Heather Hughes at London](/content/images/2019/06/2019-london-hh-1.jpeg)\n\nI feel really fortunate to have had that special London experience – it was magical and I was buzzing for days afterwards.  I couldn’t have done it without the Harriers, who helped to get me through all those hard winter months of training, and Sarah and Heather, my main training partners who push me to be better all the time.  This club is the best!\n\n![2019 London Marathon finishers: Hannah Brierley, Joseph Hayes, Craig Jones and Heather Hughes](/content/images/2019/06/2019-london-finishers.jpeg)\n\nIf you fancy giving London a go remember we get a club place every year.  Priority goes to those who have:\n\n1) Entered via the ballet and been rejected; and\n2) Finished the summer club champs.\n\nIf there's more than one person meeting these criteria then the committee pull the name out of the hat but you have to be in it to win it.  Good luck!\n\n&mdash; Hannah Brierley",

We've got some news about an exciting new cup competition that promises to add a little bit of extra excitement, and an element of intra-club competition to your weekly parkrun activities!\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA handicapped knockout cup competition commencing in August (date TBC)\n\n**Where is it?**\n\nParkrun locations to be agreed with your competitor\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nNames will be drawn from a hat to compete against each other at parkrun.  The winner progresses to the round, and so on until the cup winner is determined in a final round.\n\n**What if I'm drawn against a faster runner?**\n\nThere will be a handicapping system to give everyone a fair and equal chance of winning.  When you submit your entry for the competition, we'll also ask you to submit your fastest parkrun time this year.  When the two competitors race against each other at parkrun on the day, the difference between their submitted PBs will be added to the faster runner's time and the winner will be the one with the fastest time, after the handicap has been added.  Simple!\n\n**How many rounds will there be?**\n\nThis will depend on the number of entries, but for example if there are 32 entrants we'll need 5 rounds.\n\n**Which parkrun will we race at?**\n\nThis is entirely up to the competitors to decide between them.  It may be nice for as many of the matches to be held at the same parkrun on the same day but we know this may not always be possible. \n\n**When should we hold our matches?**\n\nWe'll provide a window in which matches will need to be completed, in order to keep the competition progressing.  Again it may be nice to hold all of the matches on the same day but again we appreciate that this isn't always possible so it will be for the competitors to decide the date between them.\n\n**What next?**\n\nIf you'd like to enter, please [get in touch with Rachel Meredith](mailto:hello@manyharrier.co.uk?subject=parkrun%20cup) to register your entry.  Don't forget to also include your fastest parkrun time of 2019.  Rach will collate the entries, and draw the names to set up the fixtures.  We'll post the fixtures on the club website and notify you when they're ready to view, and when you should complete your match by.  We'll aim to start the competition on the first weekend in August.\n\nGood luck everybody!",

The winner progresses to the round, and so on until the cup winner is determined in a final round.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if I'm drawn against a faster runner?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There will be a handicapping system to give everyone a fair and equal chance of winning.  When you submit your entry for the competition, we'll also ask you to submit your fastest parkrun time this year.  When the two competitors race against each other at parkrun on the day, the difference between their submitted PBs will be added to the faster runner's time and the winner will be the one with the fastest time, after the handicap has been added.  Simple!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How many rounds will there be?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This will depend on the number of entries, but for example if there are 32 entrants we'll need 5 rounds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which parkrun will we race at?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is entirely up to the competitors to decide between them.  It may be nice for as many of the matches to be held at the same parkrun on the same day but we know this may not always be possible. </p>\n\n<p><strong>When should we hold our matches?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We'll provide a window in which matches will need to be completed, in order to keep the competition progressing.  Again it may be nice to hold all of the matches on the same day but again we appreciate that this isn't always possible so it will be for the competitors to decide the date between them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you'd like to enter, please <a href=\"mailto:hello@manyharrier.co.uk?subject=parkrun%20cup\">get in touch with Rachel Meredith</a> to register your entry.  Don't forget to also include your fastest parkrun time of 2019.  Rach will collate the entries, and draw the names to set up the fixtures.  We'll post the fixtures on the club website and notify you when they're ready to view, and when you should complete your match by.  We'll aim to start the competition on the first weekend in August.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck everybody!</p>",

Who wouldn't want to do this event? So, we entered the race, applied for our visas, obtained our medical certificates, booked the hotel and flights and off we went. Oh and we also did a bit of training.\n\nThe journey to Moscow via Munich went smoothly enough and we were very pleased to successfully navigate ourselves via express train and Metro from the airport to our hotel. Our first hurdle being that not a soul in Moscow spoke any English and we had just four words of Russian between us.\n\nOur hotel, to the north of the city, was comfortable and conveniently situated above a Metro station and next to a number of restaurants. Despite this the second hurdle we encountered was nourishment.  Portion sizes in those restaurants were minuscule and to be frank, we only had one decent meal the whole trip. Fortunately we had taken plenty of emergency supplies with us: cereal bars, porridge and nuts etc. all of which we devoured.\n\nOn Friday morning we did a recce of the journey to the start and the first few kilometres of the race route and it all looked promising. In the afternoon we took a tour of the Kremlin and Red Square which was extremely interesting. Security was on high alert as Vladimir was in town.\n\nEarly start on Saturday morning to pick up our race numbers conveniently situated a million miles from town in an industrial park. Fortunately the Metro system is very cheap and efficient. Unfortunately it is overcrowded and unpleasant. The people of Moscow live like dwarfs, underground, pushing and shoving through tunnel after tunnel. They don't speak, they don't smile and they hardly ever surface. The city is not designed for pedestrians or cyclists so, if you're not in a car, you are fated to be subterranean. \n\nIn the afternoon we attempted to go on a boat trip on the River Moskva and encountered hurdle number three, find a boat trip with an English audio guide. We paid our money having been assured there was an English audio guide on the boat. Within 30 seconds of boarding it became apparent that no such guide existed. We remonstrated vigorously with the sales person who admitted defeat and begrudgingly refunded our money – wouldn't you! \n\nEarly to bed on Saturday night, with rumbling stomachs, as we wondered what race day would bring.\n\nHurdle number four, the marathon. Sunday was grey, cold, wet and windy – just what we had dreamed of! The journey to the start went without a hitch but we found ourselves still in the toilet queue as the race started. No problem though because it took almost half an hour to get over the start line by which time we were frozen to the core. The route, mainly on long straight dual carriageways, was in no way picturesque. However, we did see the Kremlin wall and some golden domes in the distance.  On the right day it could be a PB route but on this day icy rain lashed down and the wind gusted to such a degree that some barriers and kilometre markers were blown over. Carol had stomach trouble due to the hideous Moscow tap water necessitating a trip or two to the public loos (not recommended) and I had cramp in my right calf probably due to standing in the start pen for so long. For the last few miles of the race I could feel the air pollution affecting my lungs.  We were very relieved to see the end and happy with our times considering the testing conditions. No post-race party for us, we hobbled back to the hotel and were in bed by 9pm.\n\nMonday dawned bright and even colder as we took an excellent walking tour round the historical centre and as a reward for all our efforts, indulged in a chocolate lunch at the finest hotel in town. In the afternoon we overcame hurdle number five and finally, on our third attempt, secured tickets for the much admired armoury collection.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, keen to get some fresh air before travelling home, we set off to find a park. Hurdle number six, construction work. Much of the park was barriered off so finding a way in was challenging. However, we were not defeated and managed a full loop of monuments dedicated to war, death and destruction. Buoyed by our jolly walk we quickly packed and retraced our steps to the airport.\n\nOverall the trip was an adventure we are glad we experienced but we are very happy to be back amongst friendly faces in smiley Manchester!\n  \n&mdash; Carol O'Hare and Steph Goodchild\n",
